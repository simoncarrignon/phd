
Abstract:
In this paper, I defend libertarianism (i.e., the view that humans have libertarian free will) against philosophical and scientific objections.  The main philosophical objection is sometimes called the Mind argument, or the luck objection; in responding to this objection, I argue that there’s a certain subset of our decisions that have the following property: if they are undetermined in the right way, then they are libertarian free.  This conclusion turns the traditional Mind argument upside-down; if my argument is cogent, then it shows that the question of whether we possess libertarian free will reduces to an empirical question about whether certain of our decisions are undetermined in the right way.  Finally, in the second half of the paper, I respond to a few scientific objections to libertarianism, arguing that we do not have any good empirical reasons to doubt the hypothesis that our decisions are undetermined in the right way.  Now, it seems clear that we also don’t have any good reason to believe this hypothesis, and so my overall conclusion is that the question of whether we possess libertarian free will is an open empirical question.
