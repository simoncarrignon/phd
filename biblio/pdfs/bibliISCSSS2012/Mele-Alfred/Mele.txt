Abstract:
I will discuss some alleged evidence (from Libet, for example) that conscious intentions never play a role in producing corresponding actions and some alleged evidence (from studies of implementation intentions) that they sometimes do play this role.  I then take up the question whether conscious reasoning ever plays a role in the production of intentions and actions.  I set the stage for my discussion by rehearsing a familiar scientific argument for the claim that free will is an illusion.
