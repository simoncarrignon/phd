Neurophysiological and hemodynamic measurements of spontaneous activity and functional connectivity

Abstract:
Recent functional MRI (fMRI) studies have demonstrated large amplitude slow (< 0.1 Hz) fluctuations in humans in the resting state. Importantly, these spontaneous fluctuations in the Blood-Oxygenation-Level-Dependent (BOLD) signal are often synchronized over distant parts of the brain, a phenomenon termed resting-state functional connectivity. Functional connectivity analysis identifies resting-state networks of areas that also coactivate in response to stimuli or tasks. In my talk, Iâ€™ll first explore whether fMRI-measured spontaneous fluctuations are similar to those seen in neurophysiological activity. I will then demonstrate that resting-state functional connectivity exists in a hierarchical manner in space. In addition to the commonly reported networks on the spatial scale of cortical areas, smaller networks can be observed at the resolution scales of sub-areas and cortical columns. I will conclude with hypotheses on the mechanisms involved, the role of spontaneous activity, and implications to clinical neuroscience.
