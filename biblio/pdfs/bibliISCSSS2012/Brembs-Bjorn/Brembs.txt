Title: 
Behavioral Freedom and Decision-Making in Flies - an Evolutionary Precursor of 'Free Will'? 

Abstract:
The collaborative actions of chance and necessity make up the
foundation of evolutionary success: the deterministic rules
of selection act upon the stochastic genetic variation to
bring about adaptive change. Genetics studies both the
variability of genomes and the almost faithful transmission
of genetic information from generation to generation. The
same concerted action of chance and necessity underlies
bacterial chemotaxis: Escherichia coli uses straight runs and
random tumbles to orient in odor plumes. In both instances,
we understand both the mechanisms underlying the generation
of variability and those of the the deterministic
components. The behavior of organisms with nervous systems
also employs this powerful combination when at first
different behaviors are tried out in a new situation until
the desired goal is achieved. Subsequent encounters with the
same situation then lead to the successful behavior
increasingly quickly. While we understand the deterministic
selection processes ('reinforcement') leading to the
reliable production of the behavior comparatively well, we
know next to nothing about how the behavioral variability is
generated that provides the substrate for these selection
processes to act upon. Mutation, sexual recombination,
jumping genes or horizontal gene transfer are crucial not
only for evolution to take place, these fundamentally
stochastic processes also make evolution principally
unpredictable. Analogously, the processes by which brains
generate variable and sometimes genuinely new behaviors are
crucial for brains to generate adaptive behavioral choice
and make brains principally unpredictable. It is this
unpredictability which forms the evolutionary basis for
behavioral freedom, a candidate for the evolutionary
precursor to what we today call 'free will' in humans.
