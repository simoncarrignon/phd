</p><p>There could be no more gratifying response to a philosopher's work than
such a bounty of challenging, high-quality essays. I have learned a great
deal from them, and hope that other readers will be as delighted as I have
been by the insights gathered here. One thing I have learned is just how
much hard work I had left for others to do, by underestimating the degree
of explicit formulation of theses and arguments that is actually required
to bring these issues into optimal focus. These essays cover my work from
top to bottom. Just about every nook and cranny is probed and tested in
ways I could never do for myself. The essays thus highlight the areas of
weakest exposition of my views; they also show the weak points of the views
themselves--and suggest repairs, which I am sometimes happy to accept,
but not always, since there are a few cases in which one critic deftly
disarms another, sight unseen. I will be fascinated to learn how the individual
authors react to each other's essays, since they side with me on different
points, and disagree about what is still in need of revision or repair.

</p><p>To me the most interesting pattern to emerge is the frequency with which
the criticisms hinge on mistaken assumptions about the empirical facts.
Since I have long maintained that ignoring the relevant science is the
kiss of death in philosophy of mind, no project could be dearer to my heart
than showing how paying attention to such non-traditional details is the
key to progress. So I will give pride of place to my responses to Ivan
Fox and Fred Dretske, whose essays show most vividly the need for joining
forces with cognitive science. Then I will turn to the others, following
my usual order: considering content first, then turning to consciousness,
and finally, to the ethical considerations of personhood. It hardly needs
saying that this essay, long as it is, would be twice as long if I responded
to all the points raised that deserve discussion.<a href="http://cogprints.org/280/1/getreal.htm#1.">Endnote

</p><p><b>Ivan Fox</b>'s essay may very well be the most important essay in
the collection, an original breakthrough in phenomenology that can really
move us into a new understanding--or it may not be. I just can't tell.
I have by now spent many hours struggling with it, an experience that puts
me in mind of one of the delights of sailing on the coast of Maine: the
exhilarating phenomenon known as scale up. You are sailing along in a dense
pea-soup fog, the sails dripping, the foghorn moaning nearby but unlocatable
in the white-out, visibility less than fifty yards; you move cautiously,
checking and double-checking the compass, the depth sounder, the chart,
looking out for dangers on all sides, working hard and feeling tense and
uncertain, and then all of a sudden you sail out of the fogbank into glorious
sunshine, with miles of visibility, blue sky, sparkling water, a fresh
breeze. Yeehah! That's the way I felt reading his paper. There were long
patches of fog that I struggled through, unsure I knew where I was or where
I was headed, and then suddenly I'd find myself bathed in clear, insightful
going, a novel course through recognizable landmarks. Yeehah! Then back
into the fog, anxiously waiting for the next scale up. We Downeasters have
learned to take a perverse pleasure in living through the foggy passages
for the rewards of a good scale up. But in philosophy there ought to be
a better way. It is not that Fox has overlooked an <i>easy</i> way of proceeding;
anyone who has actually tried hard to say what happens in conscious perception
will appreciate that he is not making up difficulties and fancy ways of
dealing with them. The more straightforward ways of saying what happens
are all seriously confused and deeply misleading, for the reasons he enunciates--a
verdict my commentaries on some of the other essays will support in due
course.

</p><p>A better way--not an easier way--would get clearer about what the rules
of such an enterprise are, what counts as being right or wrong, what sorts
of implications <i>and applications</i> these ideas have. Here is my methodological
proposal. <i>If</i> Fox is on an important new track, as I suspect, then
it ought to be possible to recast all of it--all of it--in terms that have
a direct and helpful bearing on a project I am working on these days: the
Cog project in robotics, directed by Rodney Brooks and Lynn Andrea Stein
at the AI Lab at MIT. Cog is a humanoid robot, situated in real (not virtual)
space and time, with human-sized eyes, arms, hands, and torso that move
like human body parts, innervated by sensors for "touch" and "pain" (scare-quotes
for the squeamish), and designed to undergo a long period of "infancy,"
not growing larger, but learning hand-eye coordination and much, much more--e.g.,
folk physics and even folk psychology--the way we human beings do: by being
experientially embedded in a concrete world of things that can harm, help
and otherwise "interest" it. (Dennett, 1994) Cog will have to track individual
objects, reidentify them, interact gracefully with them, protect its own
bodily integrity and safety, and--in our fondest blue sky aspirations--come
to talk about its life, its subjectivity, in this concrete world it shares
with us.

</p><p>Among the opportunities and problems that Cog will confront are instances
very much like Fox's example of pulling the thorn from the finger. So will
Cog's cognitive architecture have to incorporate his "surrogates"--representa<i>tives</i>
instead of "representa<i>tions</i>"? That sounds very much like the idealogy
for which Rodney Brooks is famous in AI circles. He is, after all, the
author of "Intelligence without Representation," (1991), one of the most
influential manifestos of the new anti-GOFAI (and hence anti-LOT) <a href="http://cogprints.org/280/1/getreal.htm#3.">Endnote
3</a> school of AI, and like Fox, he has all along stressed the <i>practical</i>
importance of not interposing intellectualist systems of sentential objects
between input and output in robots that must cope in real time and space.
When Fox speaks of our creating the Cartesian modes as a reflection that
does not disturb the underlying Empedoclean modes of acquaintance, this
is thus tantalizingly close to Brooks' subsumption architecture, in which
new sophistications have to be piled on top of earlier systems of distributed
perceptuo-locomotory prowess. One might well wonder if Fox has simply re-invented
some of Brooks's wheels, in a daunting new vocabulary, so perhaps, after
all, he has no new insights to offer to the Cog team, who long ago turned
their backs on High Church Computationalism, in spite of their domicile
at the East Pole (Dennett, 1987). Or perhaps he has seen, from his phenomenological
and philosophical vantage point, some crucial sharpenings and advances
that the Cog team must come to appreciate and somehow honor in their engineering
if they are ever to get Cog to do what they want Cog to do.

</p><p>My first ambition was to figure out for myself what the "take home message"
of Fox's essay would be for the Cog group. Translating phil-speak points
into their terms is a task I often undertake these days, and I find it
is always a salutary exercise. The faculty and graduate students in the
group are both open-minded and astonishingly quick studies--utterly unfazable
by technicalities, both theoretical and empirical. But they are also deeply
practical; they are embarked on an extraordinarily ambitious and difficult
project, and any advice offered had better actually rule something out
that they might have been tempted to try, or rule something in that they
might otherwise have overlooked. They won't be impressed if you tell them
that unless they ensure that Cog has <i>x</i>, Cog won't have, say, <i>intrinsic</i>
intentionality--unless you can go on to demonstrate that without intrinsic
intentionality (whatever you take that to be), Cog will blunder about,
or fail to acquire the sought-for competences, or go all Hamlet-like in
some combinatorial explosion of futile looping, or destroy itself. If Cog
can locate the thorns, readily recognize their negativity, be moved somehow
by this recognition to attempt to remove them, and succeed (in jig time),
it will be hard to sell the Cog team on the complaint that Cog nevertheless
lacks the <i>je ne sais quoi</i> that distinguishes our own acts of thorn-removal.

</p><p>But I have been simply unable to state to myself with any confidence
what Fox's message is, in the end. Cog's manifest image, he seems to be
saying, must incorporate an ontology that is irreducibly naive--an ontology
that resists going in either of the two directions sophisticated philosophical
analysis demands. I think this is an extremely promising idea, but what
does it mean in implementation terms? What shouldn't be there and what
should be there? How does one get "gestalting" into Cog's processes, for
instance, and how do you tell if you've succeeded? I cannot answer these
questions yet. I encourage Fox to pose the problems for himself. I am not
so swept up in this robotics project, or so doctrinaire, as to <i>require</i>
that anything worth doing in philosophy of mind be translatable into valuable
Cog-speak. There may well be many important projects in philosophy of mind
or phenomenology that have scant bearing, or no bearing at all, on the
particular problems of engineering and robot psychology confronting the
Cog team. But for an enterprise that is in danger of losing its grip on
reality--a common enough danger in all areas of philosophy--this is at
least <i>a</i> way of virtually guaranteeing that whatever one asserts
or denies tackles a real problem (however wrongheadedly).

</p><p>There are plenty of passages in Fox's essay that encourage me to think
that he does aspire to inform such engineering projects. Since he readily
allows fish to have surrogates in thought [p27], I doubt if he would turn
up his nose at robot cognition. He dismisses one model of how one picks
up a cup by saying "Life is too short, and there is too much of routine
in action to make this a feasible or worthwhile cognitive architecture."
[p20]. He also speaks of the "Mac-wiring of the two-worlds system" as the
feature that ensures that the external object is appropriately treated
by the agent's fears, desires and plans. Here (and elsewhere) he seems
to be giving "the specs"--but in philosophical, not engineering, terms--for
the only sort of system that can achieve good, real, effective (or at any
rate <i>our kind of</i>) cognition. As he says, "This experienced directness
is the entitlement of unreflective naive realism accomplished through surrogate
objects. It is not available to a mind that perceives by way of representations
and acts solely on information." [p.28] At other times, it seems as if
he chickens out, recanting this aspiration altogether. For we learn in
the end that "if we cannot distinguish behaviorally" between a Cog that
has surrogates and a Cog that uses representations, "this shows the limits
of behaviorism." [p56]. He goes right on to say that his distinction is
"as objectively determinable as any fact of cognitive architecture" but
one wonders what practical importance (e.g., for the rush of controlling
behavior in real time) this difference of cognitive architecture has, and
how, from the third-person point of view, we can determine this objective
difference. <a href="http://cogprints.org/280/1/getreal.htm#4.">Endnote 4</a>

</p><p>I do not think this is a minor criticism. When Husserl made his famous
distinction between the hyletic and noetic phase, he neatly saved Phenomenologists
from dirtying their hands with the grubby physical details of the hyletic
phase, but only at the very serious risk of trivializing Phenomenology
for all time. The breath of fresh air (and sparkling sunshine) in Fox's
phenomenology is his recognition, at many points and in many ways, that
his enterprise <i>is</i> a species of extremely abstract engineering, but
then he too often seems to me to shrug off the hard questions as somebody
else's responsibility. <a href="http://cogprints.org/280/1/getreal.htm#5.">Endnote 5</a>When Fox says "The body
of the Other warps the structure of phenomenal space-time and draws mine
to it along the geodesic of desire," [p51] that's a nifty description of
the wonderful effect achieved by our brains. But we want to know: how is
it done? His claims about surrogates strike me as a very useful proposal,
somewhat along the lines of similar suggestions by Ruth Millikan (e.g.,
1993), and these promise a route for getting away from the language of
thought. Fine, but now either you pass the buck entirely to the engineers
and just declare that the problem has a solution (no doubt it does), or
you attempt to contribute to the solution. I'm not asking for wiring diagrams,
but just for a closer <i>rapprochement</i>--something I could tell to the
Cog team that they could understand.

</p><p>By insensible phylogenetic degrees the phenomenal world emerges at the
turning point of the reflex arc. I do not doubt that there is something
which it is like to be a bat, or a bee. . . . The dimwitted orgasm of an
earthworm is as truly phenomenology as our own multimedia experience. What
is marvelous about our phenomenology is not that it is <i>phenomenology</i>
but that it is <i>marvelous</i> phenomenology--nature's three billion year
solution to the problem of achieving in one state the surrogate of the
perceived world; a world within a world conceived by nature in its own
image. No doubt this engineering feat requires very special properties.
You can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear, and the phenomenal world
is silk purse phenomenology. [p46]

</p><p>And what does Fox have to say about how to accomplish this engineering
feat? His opening gambit of explaining the phenomenal world via the metaphor
of the Mac user-interface is cute, but I fear it backfires. <a href="http://cogprints.org/280/1/getreal.htm#6.">Endnote
6</a> If "the phenomenal world is the end of the line," [p11] this implies
that there are no <i>further</i> internal users or appreciators or perceivers,
but then this is a major disanalogy with the user illusion of the word
processor. He seems to be saying--and I very much agree--that the phenomenal
world is the emergent product of all the corner-turning (<i>Consciousness
Explained</i> [hereafter <i>CE</i>], 1991, pp108-111), <i>not</i> the preamble
or final raw material before the corner of consciousness is turned. The
Mac user-interface, however, <i>isn't</i> the end of the line; it is designed
to present material to a user--that's the whole point of it. And its engineering
is indeed tricky, but nowhere near as tricky as the engineering that seems
to be required for Fox's phenomenal world, in which round-<i>for-all-intents-and-purposes</i>
and its brethren must be implemented. If this is virtual roundness--like
the virtual hardness of the virtual cast on Marcel Marceau's arm (<i>CE</i>
p.211)--then an abyss opens up. How do you make it true that "surrogate
objects and their properties track external objects and their properties"?
[p10]

</p><p>Zenon Pylyshyn has often warned cognitive scientists not to posit what
he memorably calls "mental clay," a magical material out of which to fashion
internal surrogates whose causal properties automatically track the physics
of their external counterparts. Donald Knuth, a hero of computer programmers
everywhere, made a lovely innovation in text-formatting technology when
he invented virtual "glue," a virtually elastic and virtually sticky substitute
for the rigid space called up by the typewriter space bar. Putting a varying
virtual dab between each pair of words, depending on their relative lengths,
his formatting program then virtually stretched the word-string by virtually
pulling on its virtual ends till it fit perfectly between the left and
right margins, apportioning just the right among of extra white space for
each gap between words. Fortunately, Knuth didn't also have to make his
word-processing glue virtually shiny, tasty, and smelly, but Fox's surrogates,
in contrast, seem to have a full complement of for-all-intents-and-purposes
perceptual properties. "To serve as a surrogate for an F thing in this
system, an internal object must have such causal properties as enable it
to be the target of F relevant object attitudes and to govern the ensuing
action in F relevant ways." [p21] Beyond allowing that so far as he is
concerned, surrogates can <i>literally</i> have <i>some</i> of the relevant
causal properties--they can be literally ellipsoid, or "an unindividuated
color" for instance [p22]--Fox is silent on how to deal with this problem.
I fear his silence is proxy for "And then a miracle happens." I hope I
have misunderstood him.

</p><p>If Fox's surrogates are not <i>literally</i> surrogates, made of mental
clay, what are they? If they are intentional objects, Fox's phenomenology
reduces to my heterophenomenology, an account of the believed-in entities,
only on occasion and indirectly an account of the internal states and processes.
That is fine with me, but then his claim to have pushed beyond heterophenomenology
to a radically different ontology must evaporate. Too bad, since we all
need to push further into the engineering, and not just revel in the specs.

</p><p><i>2.&nbsp;<a name="Dretske&#39;s"></a>Dretske's Blind Spot</i>

</p><p><b>Fred Dretske</b> is wonderfully direct in his essay. No glancing
blows here; one of us is flat wrong. And surprisingly, for a philosophical
essay, our differences--if I understand him--have quite directly testable
empirical consequences. In a passage Dretske quotes, I say that "the richness
of the world outside, in all <i>its</i> ravishing detail . . . does not
'enter' our conscious minds, but is simply available," to which he forthrightly
retorts: "This is false. . . . Our experience of this ravishing detail
does cease when we close our eyes. So the ravishing detail is not <i>only</i>
'in' the world." I do not know why he thinks this last bit follows, unless
he is mistakenly assuming that our experience of ravishing detail must
itself be ravishingly detailed, but this is just what is called in question
by recent experiments that dramatically support my version of the facts.
Even more telling, a recent thought experiment of Dretske's (in "Conscious
Experience," 1993) perfectly anticipates one of these real experiments
and encourages us to imagine an outcome seriously at odds with the actual
results. <a href="http://cogprints.org/280/1/getreal.htm#8.">Endnote 8</a> But before we get to that <i>dénouement</i>,
I must set the stage.

</p><p>Dretske has been a firm believer in the importance of "non-epistemic
seeing" ever since his 1969 book, <i>Seeing and Knowing</i>, which I did
read and admire when it came out, but he did not at all persuade me of
the importance of non-epistemic seeing. (Many of the difficulties I saw
were picked up by Virgil Aldrich in his 1970 <i>J.Phil</i>. review of the
book, by the way.) Dretske uses non-epistemic seeing to mark what he takes
to be a theoretically important category: "entering conscious experience."
His isolation of non-epistemic seeing struck me in 1969 as at best a harmless
tidbit of ordinary language philosophy; now I think it is worse: a theorist's
illusion, pure and simple, an artifact of taking ordinary language too
seriously. There is no important difference--no difference that makes a
difference--between things non-epistemically seen (e.g., the thimble in
front of Betsy's eyes before she twigs) and things not seen at all (e.g.,
the child smirking behind Betsy's back). <a href="http://cogprints.org/280/1/getreal.htm#9.">Endnote 9</a>

</p><p>Common usage does, as he says, endorse a third-person use of "see."
As he puts it now: "Ask someone! Other people may be able to supply information
which, together with what you already know, helps you discover what (or
who) you saw." (fn15) For instance, you're standing deep in the waving
crowd as Hillary Rodham Clinton's motorcade passes by--"I wonder if she
saw me!" you exclaim, and your companion says "Sure--you're tall enough,
her eyes were open, and she kept looking back and forth from one side of
the street to the other. If you saw her, she saw you." Big deal. (While
we're doing ordinary language philosophy, notice that your companion might
just as naturally have said "Since you could see her, she could see you."
This raises a difficult question for Dretske to answer: how does <i>visible
to A at time t</i> differ in meaning from <i>non-epistemically seen by
A at time t</i>? Does it follow from the fact that Ms. Clinton <i>could</i>
see you that she <i>did</i> see you?)

</p><p>The third-person-attributable usage Dretske draws to our attention is
common enough, but it survives on ignorance--the everyday ignorance of
ordinary folk about how their visual systems work. It assumes, roughly,
that if your eyes are wide open and you're awake, then everything that
is "right in front of your eyes" has a common marked status--the status
Dretske marks as <i>seen</i> (in the non-epistemic sense). The idea is
that this is all it takes, normally, to get a visible thing <i>registered</i>
(or "exhibited" as he now says) in the sighted person's "consciousness".
Not being able to see inside people's heads to confirm that the imagined
normal registration has in fact taken place, we treat the outward signs
as proof enough. We can honor this status in a sort of legalistic way if
we desire, but the facts about human vision render this understanding Pickwickian
in the extreme. (If your transpacific plane touches down for refueling
in Tahiti and you sleep through the landing and takeoff, can you say you've
been to Tahiti? Yes, you can. Big deal.) Ordinary folk do not realize that
one's "visual field" is gappy, degrades shockingly in resolution in the
parafoveal regions, and--most important of all--is not recorded for comparison
from moment to moment.

</p><p>Long before there was film, there were cameras. The <i>camera obscura</i>
is literally a dark room with a pinhole opening (perhaps enhanced by a
lens) in one wall, and on the opposite wall a full-color (upside-down)
image of the outside world is exhibited, evanescently, for onlookers inside
the <i>camera</i> to see and enjoy. The room doesn't see, of course, even
though the information is <i>there</i> on the wall. Suppose I walk by a
<i>vacant</i> camera obscura and make a face in the direction of its pinhole.
This guarantees that my smirk, in high resolution color, was briefly present
on the opposite wall--an inert historical fact. Big deal. A <i>camera obscura</i>
does not in any sense see what is exhibited on its wall. Or consider a
camcorder, turned on but not recording. Unlike the wall of the <i>camera
obscura</i>, there are photosensitive elements here that are evanescently
changed by the photons raining down on them, but they change back immediately,
leaving no trace. Even when the camcorder is recording, it still doesn't
see, of course, but intuitively it takes a step in the right direction,
since it records (some of) that information, for some later use, appreciation,
analysis. A trace is made; the information sticks around. But presumably
a camcorder doesn't do enough with the information to count as seeing,
even when it makes a record of what happens.

</p><p>It is a problem for Dretske to say what more is needed for non-epistemic
seeing to occur. He makes an analogy: "seeing is like touching" [p.3].
We may ask: Is it like a rock touching the soil it is embedded in, or like
a tree's roots touching that soil, or is it like a mole's paws touching
it? Presumably the last of these, but why? Not, apparently, because moles
have "conceptual" categories that can sort the information; seeing can
occur "in the absence of conceptual uptake" [p.2], and "your experience
can exhibit even though you may not be able to judge that something is
." [p.14] Presumably, the mole's experience "exhibits" the soil, but the
tree is just as much in contact with the soil, and responds, slowly, to
that contact. What more would be needed for the tree to exhibit the soil
in its experience?

</p><p>This is a good place to see the stark contrast between Dretske's view
and mine. "The difference," he says, "between a visual experience and a
belief about what you experience seems reasonably clear pre-theoretically."
[p.9] I agree--it <i>seems</i> to be, but this is one of those treacherous
philosophical observations. He says it is impossible to give a plausible
theory of consciousness as long as experience and belief are conflated;
I say it is impossible to give a plausible theory of consciousness as long
as experience is deemed to be entirely independent of belief--or something
rather like belief. Belief is not quite the right term for the job, as
I have noted.

</p><p>When Dretske says that the micro-cognitions I substitute for beliefs
do "precisely" what potential or suppressed beliefs did for Armstrong and
Pitcher, he misses a major point: I was deliberately getting away from
their mistaken personal-level treatment of the issue, so my micro-cognitions
do an importantly (precisely) different job. The personal level treatment
misconstrues the facts--in the ways and for the reasons that Dretske points
out:

</p><p>One has certainly <i>not</i> shown that seeing an object, being perceptually
aware of a thimble, consists in a <i>judgment</i> that it is a thimble
(or anything else) in anything like the ordinary sense of the word 'judgment'.[p10]

</p><p>Exactly right. You have to go to a non-ordinary sense of the word 'judgment'
to make this claim hold, and hold it must, since otherwise we are stuck
unable to tell the <i>camera obscura</i> from the genuine seer. What a
genuine seer must do is somehow take in and "categorize" or "recognize"
or "discriminate" or "identify" or . . . . (each term stretched out of
its ordinary field) . . . in some other way "judge" the presence of something
(as a thimble or as something else). With such uptake there is seeing.
Otherwise not. Dretske asks [p.4] "Are we really being told that it makes
no sense to ask whether one can see, thus be aware of, thus be conscious
of, objects before being told what they are?" Yes, in one sense, and no,
in another. I am indeed challenging the claim that there is a coherent
sense of "conscious" and "aware" and "see" linked in the manner of his
question, but I quite agree that it "makes sense" to ask Dretske's question
in the course of some ordinary affairs; it also makes sense to speak of
the sun setting, and of breaking somebody's heart.

</p><p>Notice that Dretske's sense of "see," ordinary and familiar though it
is, is utterly powerless to deal with the following questions: (1) Does
the blindsight subject see objects in the blind field? He can react to
them in some ways and not others. (2) Does the blue-eyed scallop see? It
has eyes.<a href="http://cogprints.org/280/1/getreal.htm#10.">Endnote 10</a> (3) Does a sleepwalker see? He engages
in visually guided locomotion. (4) Does the anesthetized person with open
eyes see? (5) Does the hysterically blind person see? (6) Do you see objects
that are parafoveal in your visual field? How far parafoveal? It is obvious
that in order to answer any of these questions, we have to go beyond the
ordinary grounds for attributing seeing--which draw a blank--and ask what
is going on inside. To a first approximation, the question then becomes:
is what is going on inside more like what happens in a vacant camera obscura
or more like what happens in a camcorder when it is recording? Is there
uptake, and if so of what?

</p><p>And the answer is that to a surprising degree, the visual part of your
brain is more like a <i>camera obscura</i> than you might have thought.
On the last page (468) of <i>CE</i>, I described an experiment with eye-trackers
that had not been done, and predicted the result. The experiment has since
been done, by John Grimes (forthcoming) at the Beckmann Institute in Champaign
Urbana, and the results were much more powerful than I had dared hope.
I had inserted lots of safety nets (I was worried about luminance boundaries
and the like--an entirely gratuitous worry as it turns out). Grimes showed
subjects high-resolution color photographs on a computer screen, and told
the subjects to study them carefully, since they would be tested on the
details. (The subjects were hence highly motivated, like Betsy, to notice,
detect, discriminate, or judge whatever it was they were seeing.) They
were also told that there <i>might</i> be a change in the pictures while
they were studying them (for ten seconds each). If they ever saw (yes,
"saw," the ordinary word) a change, they were to press the button in front
of them--even if they could not say (or judge, or discriminate) what the
change was. So the subjects were even alerted to be on the lookout for
sudden changes. Then when the experiment began, an eyetracker monitored
their eye movements, and during a randomly chosen saccade changed some
large and obvious feature in each picture. (Some people think I must be
saying that this feature was changed, and then <i>changed back</i>, during
the saccade. No. The change is accomplished during the saccade, and the
picture remains changed thereafter.) Did the subjects press the button,
indicating they had seen a change? Usually not; it depended on how large
the change was. Grimes, like me, had expected the effect to be rather weak,
so he began with minor, discreet changes in the background. Nobody ever
pressed the button, so he began getting more and more outrageous. For instance,
in a picture of two cowboys sitting on a bench, Grimes exchanges their
heads during the saccade and still, most subjects don't press the button!
In an aerial photograph of a bright blue crater lake, the lake suddenly
turns jet black--and half the subjects are oblivious to the change, in
spite of the fact that this is a portrait of the lake. (What about the
half that did notice the change? They had apparently done what Betsy did
when she saw the thimble in the epistemic sense: noted, judged, identified,
the lake as blue.)

</p><p>What does this show? It shows that your brain doesn't bother keeping
a record of what was flitting across your retinas (or your visual cortex),
even for the fraction of a second that elapses from one saccade to the
next. So little record is kept that if a major change is made during a
saccade--during the changing of the guards, you might say--the difference
between the scene thereafter and the scene a fraction of a second earlier,
though immense, is typically not just unidentifiable; it is undetectable.
The earlier information is just about as evanescent as the image on the
wall in the <i>camera obscura</i>. Only details that were epistemically
seen trigger the alarm when they are subsequently changed. If we follow
Dretske's usage, however, we must nevertheless insist that, for whatever
it is worth, the changes in the before and after scenes were not just visible
to you; you <i>saw</i> them, though of course you yourself are utterly
clueless about what the changes were, or even that there were changes.

</p><p>Dretske says: "Part of what it means to say that Sarah sees all five
fingers is that if you conceal one of the fingers, things will look different
to Sarah. . . . There will not only be one less (visible) finger in the
world, but one less finger in Sarah's experience of the world." [ms, p.12]
Then I suppose it follows, trivially, that in Grimes' experiments, things
"look different"--even hugely different--to his subjects after the saccadic
switcheroo. This is, however, vacuous, given subjects' utter lack of uptake
of the difference. In what sense do things look different <i>to</i> them?
Things "look different" in the vacant <i>camera obscura</i> when I duck
out of sight after my smirk, but they don't look different <i>to</i> anybody.

</p><p>The difficulty with Dretske's view of non-epistemic seeing comes out
even more strikingly in an experiment recently conducted by Rensink, O'Regan
and Clark (forthcoming). Provoked by Grimes' result, and thinking it had
nothing to do with saccades (but everything to do with "uptake" of some
kind), they presented subjects with pictures that are interrupted, every
quarter of a second (250msec) with a black screen which remains on for
150msec. The resulting phenomenology is rather annoying: a stable picture
briefly interrupted, again and again and again. But in fact, subjects are
told, the picture changes during each interruption, going back and forth
between two pictures, with a rather large and visible difference between
them. For instance, the huge airplane that almost fills the picture grows
an extra engine on its wing twice a second. Back and forth, back and forth
go the two pictures of the plane, but you can't see any change at all!
The two pictures appear to you to be exactly the same. You study them,
focussing, scanning, inventorying, and then eventually, after perhaps twenty
or fifty back-and-forths, you notice the change. Sometimes, in spite of
thirty seconds of steady hunting, the subjects still fail to see (epistemically)
the change. This produces the same helpless and frustrating state of Betsy
hunting for the thimble. She knows it's there, right in front of her nose,
and she can't see it! But on Dretske's account, the difference is there,
back and forth, being "exhibited" in consciousness, in non-epistemic seeing.

</p><p>In fact, he gives an example (1993, p.273) of just such a pair of pictures,
which he calls Alpha and Beta. The difference between them is that Spot
(a good-sized round dot) is in Alpha but absent in Beta. Everyone who looks
at Alpha, and then at Beta, Dretske says, is "thing-aware of Spot" even
though many people may not be "fact-aware" of the difference.

</p><p>In saying that the reader is conscious of Spot--and, hence, in this
sense, the difference between Alpha and Beta--without being conscious of
the fact that they differed, we commit ourselves to the possibility of
differences in conscious experience that are not reflected in conscious
belief. (p.275)

</p><p>He imagines an objection:

</p><p>The differences are out there in the objects, yes, but who can say whether
these differences are <i>registered</i> [my emphasis] in here, in our experience
of the objects? . . . This is a way of saying that conscious experiences,
the sort of experiences you have when looking around the room, cannot differ
unless one is consciously aware that they differ. . . . This objection
smacks of verificationism, but calling it names does nothing to blunt its
appeal. (p.277)

</p><p>Right. Dretske recognizes that he needs something better than name calling
to fend off this objection, so he offers a final example, drawn from Kluver's
studies of size discrimination in monkeys. But he begs the question in
his account of how one would have to describe the monkeys' capacity, so
it doesn't in fact provide any further support for his way of looking at
seeing. <a href="http://cogprints.org/280/1/getreal.htm#11.">Endnote 11</a>

</p><p>There is no doubt that the periodic changes in the Rensink <i>et al</i>.
experiment are "exhibited" on one's retinas, and hence one's primary visual
cortex, <i>to anybody who looks at these parts of the nervous system, with
the right equipment</i>. But if you (or your homuncular agents) do not
in fact "look at" most of these exhibits with any equipment at all, the
only sense in which these changes are "registered" is the sense in which
the changes are also registered inside a camcorder that is turned on, but
not recording. This is, in fact, the normal situation--powerfully revealed
in this abnormal environment. If Dretske wants to say that this is all
he meant by non-epistemic seeing, he is welcome to the concept, but it
is not a persuasive model of "conscious experience."

</p><p>I may have just slightly exaggerated the evanescence of the "registration"
in primary visual cortex in comparing it to the temporary changes in a
camcorder's photo-sensitive elements. Perhaps there is enough long term
uptake in the brain so that, although you can't readily <i>notice</i> changes,
if given a forced choice guess about whether or not there has been a change,
you will do better than chance. Suppose we show subjects two kinds of picture
pairs: pairs like the most difficult of those in the Rensink experiment,
and pairs that are in fact identical. They will look just alike to subjects--they
will detect no changes. But if required to guess which pictures do involve
a change, they might well do better, even much better, than chance, in
spite of their utter inability to say what these changes might be. (This
experiment is currently under development in Rensink's lab.) If subjects
can make good forced choice guesses, this would conclusively show that
some information was preserved from moment to moment, that there was <i>some</i>
non-ephemeral "registration" after all. This would not serve Dretske's
purposes, however, by giving him a "difference which makes a difference"
on which to hang non-epistemic seeing <i>in conscious experience</i>, since
this performance on forced choice guessing is precisely the evidence standardly
relied on to demonstrate <i>unconscious</i> information preservation in
blindsight. I doubt that Dretske would want blindsight to count as non-epistemic
seeing.

</p><p>So, to revert to the confrontation with which we began, Dretske noted
what he takes to be a clear mistake of fact in my theory of consciousness.
I say the detail only <i>seems</i> to be "in there" and he disagrees. I
agree that it is in the eye (focused on the retina), but that is surely
not enough, for in that sense, the detail is also in the <i>camera obscura</i>.
Most of this detail is not--and cannot be--picked up <i>at all</i>, but
some of it is. The few details that are picked up are picked up <i>by being
identified</i> or categorized in some fashion--if only as blobs worthy
of further consideration, as Treisman's experiments show. <a href="http://cogprints.org/280/1/getreal.htm#12.">Endnote
12</a> It does indeed <i>seem</i> as if all the details are "in here" in
some stronger sense--a difference that makes a difference--but that is
an illusion.

</p><p><i>3.&nbsp;<a name="Truth-Makers"></a>Truth-Makers, Cow-sharks and Lecterns</i>

</p><p><b>McLaughlin and O'Leary-Hawthorne</b> have succeeded where others
have tried and failed. They have obliged me to respond, in detail worthy
of their challenge, to the question: why don't I take Swampman, Blockheads,
and their friends seriously? They have obliged me by writing an exemplary
essay, fair, patient and reasonable, setting out the problems with my view
as they (and many other philosophers) see them. They provide a compelling
exhibition of something philosophers should more often strive for: a consideration
of ideas that transcends questions of who said what when. Which of the
many variations of the ideas they consider is mine? Which did I mean? It
doesn't much matter, since they canvass all the possibilities, and try
to show which is the best--given my purposes--and why. If I didn't say
or mean that, I should have. Or so they claim, with supporting reasons.
First let me confirm a suspicion that they hint at occasionally: I have
not thought that such fanatic attention to precise formulations was work
worth doing; I still think that this is largely make-work, but there are
many, apparently, who think I am wrong, and I owe them, in my response
to this challenge, a proper reply.

</p><p>It cannot have escaped philosophers' attention that our fellow academics
in other fields--especially in the sciences--often have difficulty suppressing
their incredulous amusement when such topics as Twin Earth, Swampman, and
Blockheads are posed for apparently serious consideration. Are the scientists
just being philistines, betraying their tin ears for the subtleties of
philosophical investigation, or have the philosophers who indulge in these
exercises lost their grip on reality?

</p><p>These bizarre examples all attempt to prove one "conceptual" point or
another by deliberately reducing something underappreciated to zero, so
that What Really Counts can shine through. Blockheads hold peripheral behavior
constant and reduce internal structural details (and--what comes to the
same thing--intervening internal processes) close to zero, and provoke
the intuition that then there would be no mind there; internal structure
Really Counts. Manthra is more or less the mirror-image; it keeps internal
processes constant and reduces control of peripheral behavior to zero,
showing, presumably, that external behavior Really Doesn't Count. Swampman
keeps both future peripheral dispositions and internal states constant
and reduces "history" to zero. Twin Earth sets internal similarity to maximum,
so that external context can be demonstrated to be responsible for whatever
our intuitions tell us. Thus these thought experiments mimic empirical
experiments in their design, attempting to isolate a crucial interaction
between variables by holding other variables constant. In the past I have
often noted that a problem with such experiments is that the dependent
variable is "intuition"--they are intuition pumps--and the contribution
of imagination in the generation of intuitions is harder to control than
philosophers have usually acknowledged.

</p><p>But there is also a deeper problem with them. It is child's play to
dream up further such examples to "prove" further conceptual points. Suppose
a cow gave birth to something that was atom-for-atom indiscernible from
a shark. Would it be a shark? What is the truth-maker for sharkhood? If
you posed that question to a biologist, the charitable reaction would be
that you were making a labored attempt at a joke. Suppose an evil demon
could make water turn solid at room temperature by smiling at it; would
demon-water be ice? Too silly a hypothesis to deserve a response. All such
intuition pumps depend on the distinction spelled out by McLaughlin and
O'Leary-Hawthorne between "conceptual" and "reductive" answers to the big
questions. What I hadn't sufficiently appreciated in my earlier forthright
response to Jackson is that when one says that the truth-maker question
requires a conceptual answer, one means an answer that holds not just in
our world, or all nomologically possible worlds, but in all logically possible
worlds. <a href="http://cogprints.org/280/1/getreal.htm#13.">Endnote 13</a> Smiling demons, cow-sharks, Blockheads,
and Swampmen are all, some philosophers think, logically possible, even
if they are not nomologically possible, and these philosophers think this
is important. I do not. Why should the truth-maker question cast its net
this wide? Because, I gather, otherwise its answer doesn't tell us about
the <i>essence</i> of the topic in question. But who believes in real essences
of this sort nowadays? Not I.

</p><p>Consider the fate of "logical behaviorism" with regard to magnets. Here
are two candidate answers to the question of what the truth-maker is for
magnets: (a) all magnets are things that attract iron, and (b) all magnets
are things that have a certain internal structure (call it M-alignment).
Was the old, behavioral criterion (a) eventually superseded by the new,
internal structure criterion (b), or did the latter merely reductively
explain the former? To find out, we must imagine posing scientists the
following Swampman-style questions. Suppose you discovered a thing that
attracted iron but was not M-aligned (like standard magnets). Would you
call it a magnet? Or: Suppose you discovered a thing that was M-aligned
but did not attract iron. Would you call it a magnet? The physicists would
reply that if they were confronted with either of these imaginary objects,
they would have much more important things to worry about than what to
call them (Dennett, 1968, p234). Their whole scientific picture depends
on there being a deep regularity between the alignment of atomic dipoles
in magnetic domains and iron-attraction, and the "fact" that it is logically
possible to break this regularity is of vanishing interest to them. If
they are "logical behaviorists" about magnets, this is no doubt due to
William Gilbert's early phenomenological work in the 17th century, which
established the historical priority, if nothing else, for the classification
of magnets by what they do, not what they have inside. (He built upon,
and improved, the folk physics of magnets, in short.) What is of interest,
however, is the real covariance of "structural" and "behavioral" factors--and
if they find violations of the regularities, they adjust their science
accordingly, letting the terms fall where they may. Nominal essences are
all the essences that science needs, and some are better than others, because
they capture more regularity in nature.

</p><p>In "Do Animals have Beliefs?" (forthcoming), I say, commenting on a
point of agreement between Fodor and me:

</p><p>We both agree that a brain filled with sawdust or jello could not sustain
beliefs. There has to be structure; there have to be elements of plasticity
that can go into different states and thereby secure one revision or another
of the contents of the agent's beliefs. (p.116)

</p><p>Doesn't this passage concede everything McLaughlin and O'Leary-Hawthorne
have been pressing on me? When I say "could not" and "have to," am I speaking
of "conceptual" or "nomological" necessities? I am speaking of serious
necessities. If I ever encounter a plausible believer-candidate that violates
them, what to call it will be the least of my worries, since my whole theory
of mind will be sunk.

</p><p>So why do I lean towards "logical behaviorism" and away from the specifics
of internal activity and structure that McLaughlin and O'Leary-Hawthorne
go to such lengths to highlight? For the reasons that <b>Lynne Rudder Baker</b>
explains so well in her essay. Like Gilbert, I start with folk theory,
which is remarkably robust in the case of folk psychology. It is a discovered
fact, already well confirmed, that "peripheral narrow behavior" of the
sorts commonly observed by everyday folk, is readily predicted and explained
by folk psychology. Thus the order of explanation is from outer to inner,
not vice versa. We want a theory of the innards that can account for <i>all
that regularity</i>. It <i>might</i> have gone otherwise; it is logically
possible, I suppose, that we could have found "belief-boxes" in people's
heads that causally explained their behavior, and well-nigh identical "belief-boxes"
in the cores of redwood trees that were entirely inert. We would then have
put a premium on explaining <i>that</i> regularity of internal structure,
and let the differences in behavioral consequences tag along behind. But
we didn't find any such thing. It is not just logically possible but already
demonstrated that there are in fact many internally different ways of skinning
the behavioral cat, while it is at best logically possible, and Vanishingly
(<i>Darwin's Dangerous Idea</i>, 1995, p.109) unlikely, that we will ever
encounter Manthra, or anything else that is an internal twin lacking the
behavioral prowess.<a href="http://cogprints.org/280/1/getreal.htm#14.">Endnote 14</a>

</p><p>This all depends, of course, on how closely we look at the innards for
signs of similarity. How different do internal ways have to be to count
as different? McLaughlin and O'Leary-Hawthorne see a contradiction between
my various positions on behaviorism, and I guess they are right. I should
have <i>explained</i> why I thought that the difference between molecular
and molar behaviorism didn't amount to anything important, rather than
burking the distinction altogether. Of all the molecular differences that
there might be, the only ones that would make a difference <i>to psychology</i>
(as ordinarily understood) would be those that made a difference to the
"peripheral narrow behavior" that is predicted and explained by folk psychology.

</p><p>Consider: Tweedledum and Tweedledee both hear a joke and both laugh;
both also <i>would</i> laugh at various other jokes, would find others
unfunny, etc. Nevertheless their overall joke-getting machinery has some
differences--differences that would never show up in any peripheral behavior.
These differences are clearly (I would think) below the level of psychology.
In particular, these differences would not license a different attribution
of belief. Start with what is probably a safe limiting case. Tweedledum's
brain makes somewhat different use of potassium in its regulation of axonal
transmission than Tweedledee's brain does. Otherwise, their brains always
"do the same thing"--they are not quite molecular behavioral twins, but
pretty close. Though not molecular behavioral twins, they are nevertheless
psychological twins, for the differences are just too fine-grained to show
up in interesting psychological differences--such as different belief-attributions
on anybody's story of belief attributions. Suppose next a much larger-scale
difference: Tweedledum and Tweedledee have entirely different subcognitive
systems of face-recognition; one relies on a sort of feature-detection
checklist, and the other on some global, holistic constraint-satisfaction
scheme (<i>Brainstorms</i>, 1978, pp23-28). Now, we may suppose, they do
exhibit different <i>psychological</i> profiles (at least in relatively
abnormal circumstances): under experimental conditions, one can readily
recognize faces that the other cannot, and hence they will not share just
the same beliefs. If, contrary to plausibility, their radically different
"face-recognition modules" had exactly the same competence under all experimental
conditions, we would see the difference as an interesting physiological
difference, but too fine-grained to "count" as psychology. But where we
draw the line is not a big deal, one way or the other.

</p><p>Some philosophers may still think that in spite of all this, Blockheads
illustrate an important principle, so before taking my leave of Blockheads
I cannot resist pointing out that the "principle" relied upon by Block
in his original thought experiment is mistaken in any case. One of the
most intelligent things any thinking agent can do is plan ahead, engaging
in what we might call <i>temporally distal self-control</i>. Anticipating
that when push comes to shove at some later time, it may be difficult or
impossible to Do the Right Thing--to figure out and execute the rationally
optimal response to current circumstances--the wise agent arranges to tie
his hands a little, and cede temporally local control to a policy figured
out long ago, in cool, dilatory reflections "off line". Dieters, knowing
their urges, arrange to locate themselves in places bereft of snacks, and
when they later act in an environment that does not include "shall I have
a snack?" as a live option, this is a feature of the environment for which
they themselves are responsible, as a result of their own earlier intentional
actions, not a mere external constraint on performance. The practical navigator,
John Stuart Mill reminds us (in <i>Utilitarianism</i>), goes to sea with
the hard problems of spherical trigonometry and celestial motion pre-computed,
their answers neatly stored in a rather large (but portable) lookup table.
It is thus no sign of mindlessness, but rather of foresight, if we encounter
the navigator mechanically determining his position by looking up the answers,
swiftly, in a book.

</p><p>We think of Oscar Wilde as a great wit. It would no doubt diminish his
reputation considerably if we learned that he lay awake most nights for
hours, obsessively musing "Now what would I reply if somebody asked me.
. . , and what might my pithy opinion be of . . . . ?" Suppose we learned
that he patiently worked out, and polished, several dozen <i>bon mots</i>
per night, ingeniously indexing them in his memory, all freshly canned
and, if the occasion should arise, ready to unleash without skipping a
beat--for brevity is indeed the soul of wit. They would still be <i>his</i>
bon mots, and their funniness would depend, as the Polish comedian said,
on timing. Timing is important for almost any intelligent act--which is
why it is intelligent to anticipate and pre-solve problems wherever possible.
Wilde's brute force witticism-production scheme might disappoint us, but
in fact it draws attention to the fact that all intelligent response depends
on costly "R and D", and it doesn't make much difference how the work is
distributed in time so long as the effects are timely.

</p><p>So, contrary to Block's guiding intuition, discovering that some Turing
Test contestant was (one way or another) looking up the responses in a
giant lookup table should not at all rule out the hypothesis that this
was the manifestation of an intelligent agent at work. Local inspection
would perhaps often leave us in doubt about who the intelligent agent was
(or who they were), but we should have no doubt at all that the witticisms
on the transcripts were the product of intelligent design, responsive to
the meaning of the inputs, and just temporally removed by being solved
in the hypothetical. Intelligent design is the only way witticisms can
be made. Am I saying it is actually <i>logically necessary</i> that any
such giant lookup table of clever responses would have such an etiological
history? Heavens no. A cow-shark could give birth to one. But in our world,
the only way anything will ever pass the Turing Test is by being an intelligent,
thinking agent.

</p><p><b>Mark Richard</b> provides a close encounter that is long overdue,
confronting my "pretty pernicious instrumentalism" with a relentless challenge
from one of those who think that the way to make a proper theory of belief
is to construct and defend formal definitions of its terms. I turned my
back on the efforts of the Content Mafia (otherwise known as the Propositional
Attitude Task Force) in 1982, after publishing "Beyond Belief," in which
I gave my reasons for rejecting their methodology and enabling assumptions.
The tradition has continued in force without my blessing, of course, and
few participants have felt the need either to respond to my criticisms,
or to show how their way of philosophizing shows what is wrong with mine,
so it is high time to see how the scales balance today.

</p><p>Richard offers a three-pronged attack on my account of believers as
intentional systems: I cannot solve the lectern problem, he claims, and
two avenues which might seem to offer escape hatches for me, Stich's attempt
to distinguish beliefs from sub-doxastic states via a condition of "inferential
promiscuity," and Evans' Generality Constraint, turn out to be flawed.
If, as Richard notes, I can't adequately answer the question "What isn't
a belief?" I can't answer the question "What is a belief?" either. Not
a good verdict for a theory of belief.

</p><p>I claim to solve the lectern problem, as Richard observes, by showing
how, when predicting lectern "behavior," the intentional stance gives a
predictor no purchase over using the physical stance. "That no <i>single
event</i> is unpredictable from the Laplacean perspective does not imply
that every <i>behavioral pattern</i> is perceptible from the perspective,"
Richard notes, but he then tries to shoehorn my position into the assertion
that such behavioral patterns can be identified with the "instantiation
of a <i>ceteris paribus</i> law of property instantiation by an individual"
[p.12]. No, the impressive patterns cannot be reported in <i>single</i>
generalizations of the sort Richard illustrates; the patterns that inspire
adoption of the intentional stance consist in the success (with <i>n</i>%
noise) of a myriad of such <i>ceteris paribus</i> generalizations. No one
predictive success counts for much at all--witness the lectern's readily
predicted null behavior.

</p><p>The predictive power of the intentional stance does not derive from
our having induced kazillions of psychological "laws" which we are reminded
of whenever we see their antecedent conditions being satisfied. Where would
all these "laws" come from? We surely aren't taught them by the score.
Rather, we effortlessly <i>generate</i> our predictions from an appreciation
of the underlying normative principle of intentional stance prediction--rationality.
What we need the strategy to explain is our power to generate these predictions--describe
these patterns--<i>ad lib</i> and <i>ad hoc</i> in any number we wish,
and find the vast majority of them to be predictive way better than chance.
That's why I spoke of intentional systems whose behavior is "voluminously"
predictable, a theme Richard notes in passing, but underestimates.

</p><p>Richard then goes on to interpret my claim about the ineliminability
of the intentional characterization of people (and other true believers)
as the claim that the presumptive intentional laws governing lecterns,
unlike the intentional laws governing believers, have equally predictive--indeed
coextensive--"physical equivalents," and hence are eliminable. This misconstrues
my case. I am quite willing to grant that some unimaginably long but finite
disjunction of physically characterized conditions exhausts by brute force
the entire predictive power of any intentional stance prediction whatsoever.
So what? Such claims are not interesting; the same move could be used to
strike down every biological category (for instance), since the Heat Death
of the Universe, if nothing else, guarantees that "there is" a huge but
finite disjunction of predicates constructible by Boolean means from terms
drawn strictly from sub-atomic physics that would be exactly as predictive
as "is a herbivore" or "is hemoglobin" or "reproduces asexually." And yet
the patterns referred to by these biological terms are perfectly real.

</p><p>The guaranteed existence of such an unwieldy predicate doesn't diminish
the actual value, for purposes of prediction, of an intentionalistic predication,
and it doesn't explain what an intentionalistic claim explains. I have
improved on my Martian predictor example in <i>Darwin's Dangerous Idea</i>,
pp.412-19, in the riddle of the two black boxes. I show that there are
short, readily tested <i>causal generalizations</i> whose almost exceptionless
truth would be manifest to super-Laplaceans but utterly mysterious and
inexplicable by them unless they adopted the intentional stance. The fact
that the super-Laplaceans could predict each instance of the generalization--could
generate, given enough time, every disjunct in the unimaginably long list--would
not impress <i>them</i>, since they would see clear as day in the totality
of their predictions a simple regularity that they could not explain.

</p><p>Why does Richard go to such pains to translate my thesis into the alien
language of "<i>ceteris paribus</i> laws" and then interpret its central
claim in terms of the non-existence of equivalent sentences composed in
non-intentional vocabulary? The reason, I think, is methodological: Richard
simply cannot use the tools of his trade unless he can first turn the object
of scrutiny into such a claim. This methodological imperative comes out
more sharply when we turn to his painstakingly constructed arguments against
Stich's distinction, and Evans' Generality Constraint. Here he helps himself
on several occasions to the tempting surmise that there is a language of
thought, even though he concedes that this hypothesis may not, in the end,
make much sense when applied to human believers. Why does he do this? Because
he cannot construct his arguments without it. He is not alone, but his
forthrightness on this occasion helps to underscore a point I have made
in the past: all the fine arguments spun from the intricate examples posed
by the Propositional Attitude Task Force depend on isolating rather special
cases of what I have called opinions--linguistically infected states quite
distinct from beliefs--and showing how, if these presumably clearly identified
propositional attitudes are held constant in imagination, troubles can
be raised. Without the language of thought as a crutch to keep the "fatal"
examples from toppling over under the weight of their often bizarrely topheavy
loads of specific content, there would be no research program here at all.
<a href="http://cogprints.org/280/1/getreal.htm#15.">Endnote 15</a>

</p><p>Even if <i>our</i> thought is not invariably realized in a linguistic
medium, the existence of something whose thought was invariably so realized,
and in whom we would identify the possession of concepts with lexical mastery,
isn't impossible. [p36-7].

</p><p>Or, rather, such a being better not be impossible, since a cottage industry
of philosophical research depends on it. Part of my evidence for this claim
is the studied indifference of these philosophers, almost without exception,
to the efforts by various researchers in Artificial Intelligence and cognitive
psychology, to construct and defend models of belief that do utilize something
like a language of thought. Is Douglas Lenat's CYC project the sort of
entity Richard has in mind? It is a "belief box" containing millions of
hand-coded propositions, and insofar as it has any concepts at all, it
is in virtue of the "lexical mastery" provisioned by all those carefully
wrought definitions, as interanimated by its attached inference engine.
Is CYC a believer? The general run of opinion in cognitive science is that
CYC is a brave attempt at an impossible project. At the very least, the
burden of proof is on those who think that it <i>is</i> possible for something
we would recognize as a believer/thinker to be composed as Richard assumes.
(Of course it is possible to construct large boxes of interanimated sentences--CYC
is an actual instance--but few would think that a theory about which sentences
appeared where under what conditions in such boxes would be a theory of
belief. That is, however, one way of reading the underlying assumption
of a language of thought.)

</p><p>Richard appeals at one point to the supposition "I think in English,"
and at another point tells us of Jane, who believes "Twain's here" expresses
a truth, but doesn't realize that Mark Twain is Clemens. Later he alludes
to Smith, the poorly integrated bi-lingual, and finally to Jan, the bi-lingual
Dutchman. He needs these special cases because he has to be able to point
to propositions crisply "identified" as only a specific sentence in a particular
language can do (one can speak about sets of possible worlds, but the only
practical way of saying which set you have in mind is to go piggyback on
a specific sentence). For instance, Jan's belief that lions are in zoos
has to be identified with a specific sentence in one of Jan's languages
of thought, so it can be clung to, as one of Jan's beliefs, in spite of
the evidence that Jan is really a bit dense about lions and zoos, so dense
that he can't even "think the thought" in his other language of thought.
Richard tells us the point of the exercise: "What Jan provides us with
is <i>an example</i> of a believer for whom the Generality Constraint fails."
[p.41]

</p><p>The grandfather of all such cases is Kripke's (1979) Pierre, who believes--well,
what <i>does</i> he believe about London? While hundreds of pages have
been published about Pierre, I have not bothered adding to them, since
the proper response seemed to me to be so obvious (Dennett, 1987, p.208n).
Thanks to Kripke's clear setting out of the conditions under which Pierre
fell into his curiously ill-informed state, we know exactly what his state
of mind is. What is the problem, then? The problem is saying, formally
and without fear of embarrassing contradiction elsewhere, <i>exactly</i>
what Pierre believes. Which propositions, please, should be inscribed on
Pierre's belief-list, and how are they to be individuated? Well, it can't
be done. That's the point of the Pierre case; it neatly straddles the fence,
showing how the normally quite well-behaved conditions on belief pull against
each other in abnormal circumstances. What should one do in such a dire
circumstance? Chuckle and shrug, and say, "Well, what did you expect? Perfection?
Pierre is an imperfect believer, as we all are."

</p><p>How can I say we know exactly what Pierre's state of mind is while cheerfully
admitting that we cannot <i>say</i>, exactly, what his state of mind is
<i>in terms of propositional attitudes</i>? Simple: propositional-attitude
talk is a hugely idealized oversimplification of the messy realities of
psychology. Whenever push comes to shove in borderline cases, its demands
become unanswerable. That is my pretty pernicious instrumentalism showing,
I guess. I don't call my view instrumentalism anymore, but whatever it
should be called, my view is that propositional attitude claims are so
idealized that it is often impossible to say which approximation, if any,
to use. There is nothing unprecedented about this: biologists shrug when
asked whether herring-gulls and lesser black-backed gulls are truly different
species (<i>Darwin's Dangerous Idea</i>, p.45), and electrical engineers
are unperturbed when you point out that it is quite possible to take a
perfectly good FM tuner, and, by making a few minor revisions, turn it
into something that is maybe a genuine but lousy FM tuner and maybe not
an FM tuner at all. How close to the (ideal) "specs" does something have
to be to count as a genuine FM tuner? What if it can receive only one station?
What if it tends to receive two stations at a time? What if a cow-shark
swallows it, and its stomach acid turns it into a television set?

</p><p>The various predicaments that Richard treats as counterexamples to theories
could better be considered to be shortcomings in the particular believers,
fallings short from the ideal of inferential promiscuity, or Generality,
for instance. (Pierre is a true believer, of course, but a decidedly sub-optimal
one. Believers aren't <i>supposed</i> to get themselves into the sort of
epistemic pickle Pierre has blundered into.) Since all believers fall short
of the ideal, Stich's useful idea about how to tell beliefs from other
"subdoxastic states" should be treated as a desideratum of beliefs, not
a litmus test. Then we can see a gradation of cases, from truly embedded
or encapsulated subdoxastic states to more and more "movable" and inferentially
available states. The question of how, in the species and in the individual,
this transition to more and more versatile cognitive states occurs is fast
becoming a major theoretical issue in cognitive science (see, esp. Clark
and Karmiloff-Smith, 1993). It wisely ignores the question of how to define
belief formally. If, on the other hand, you insist on setting up a definition
of belief as a set of necessary and sufficient conditions, in the fashion
that Richard assumes obligatory, you merely guarantee that there are no
true believers, not among ordinary mortals.

</p><p>So Richard is mistaken in thinking from the outset that I take on the
obligation to offer a "principled account of the distinction between (having)
propositional attitudes, as against (having) psychological states which,
though they produce and regulate behavior, and can be assigned informational
content, are not propositional attitudes." [p.2-3] And hence he is mistaken
about the role that either Stich's or Evans' claims might play for me,
whatever role they have played in the work of others. I myself have always
thought that the Generality Constraint nicely captured the ideal--the same
ideal Fodor captures by speaking of belief fixation as "Quinian and isotropic."
It is an ideal no believer meets but all--all worthy of the name--approximate.
One of the best arguments against CYC-style models of belief could in fact
be put thus: Since it is at least very hard (and maybe impossible) for
them to meet Evans' Generality Constraint, even in approximation, there
must be some other way of organizing the innards of a believer that accounts
for the fact that believers are in general quite able to honor that constraint.

</p><p>The trouble with the tools of the trade of the Propositional Attitude
Task Force is that they cut too fine! Propositions are abstract objects,
and (according to theory) just as distinct and well-behaved as, say, integers.
If propositions measure psychological states the way numbers measure physical
states (as Paul Churchland (1979) has noted), then the belief that <i>p</i>
is not identical to the belief that <i>q</i> if <i>p</i> is not identical
to <i>q</i>. But the principles of propositional identity are tied to sentence
identity in a language. In theory, of course, proposition identity can
be specified in terms of sets of possible worlds, but in practice, the
way such a set is referred to is as the set in which a particular (English)
sentence is true. In reality, propositions are, for this reason, more like
dollars than numbers, and the precision aspired to is an illusory goal
(<i>The Intentional Stance</i>, 208).

</p><p><b>Lynn Rudder Baker</b> gives a wonderful account of the reasons why
the patterns discernible from the intentional stance should not be assumed
to be repeated, somehow, in the brain. In this regard I especially commend
her discussion (fn58) of the bogus question about the location of the money-making.
As she says, "Such questions are not serious spurs to inquiry." But other
rather similar questions are. It is the confusion of the non-serious ones
with the serious ones that causes a lot of the confusion. As Alan Turing
noted, in one of his many prophetic asides,

</p><p>I do not wish to give the impression that I think there is no mystery
about consciousness. There is, for instance, something of a paradox connected
with any attempt to localize it. (1950, p.447)

</p><p>The reality of consciousness does not require its localization in the
brain, but it still depends on features of brain activity, and if we ant
to confirm or disconfirm hypotheses about specific conscious experiences,
what we need to test is the <i>truth</i> of the claims that constitute
somebody's heterophenomenology. "It occurred to me that winters in Vermont
are long" is not about the weather; and I might be wrong in asserting it.
Nothing of the kind may have occurred to me. (Baker's analysis of this
case would be much helped by honoring <b>David Rosenthal's</b> distinction
between expressing and reporting: in uttering this sentence, I would be
<i>expressing</i> a higher order thought about my mental life in <i>reporting</i>
a lower order thought--about the weather.)

</p><p>Heterophenomenology exhausts the intentional stance theory of consciousness,
but we want more (and so we should). Consider a parallel: there is undoubtedly
a real pattern in the tales told (and believed) these days by self-styled
victims of satanic ritual abuse, but are any of their beliefs true? We'd
like to know. Similarly, there is certainly a real pattern in the tales
told (and believed) by subjects about what occurs to them at various times,
what they "do" in their minds at various times, and we'd like to know which
of these beliefs of theirs are true. That is where "brain-mapping" comes
in. Baker sees a deep tension between the intentional stance and this brain-mapping
move, mainly because she misinterprets me as thinking the brain-mapping
will be a "deeper" theory (in her terms), and thus non-intentional. Not
at all. The theory of content I espouse for the whole person I espouse
all the way in. The neurobiological theory of content is homuncular functionalism,
to dress it in its most vivid metaphorical costume, and hence the very
same principles of interpretation are used to endow sub-personal parts
with contents as are used to endow whole persons. (<b>David Rosenthal's</b>
interpretive "hypothesis" on this score is thus correct. Since he has to
work to arrive at this position, and Baker misses it, I cannot have done
a proper job of expounding it.) The way in which personal-level attributions
of belief and other intentional properties get confirmed (in the crunch)
by sub-personal attributions of (non-ordinary) intentional properties is
roughly parallel to the way in which one might confirm one's attribution
of culpable motives to, say, the British Empire, or the CIA, or IBM, by
discovering a pattern of beliefs, desires, intentions, among the agents
whose joint activity compose the actions, beliefs and intentions of the
super-personal agent (see the discussion of <b>Carol Rovane</b>, at the
end of this essay, for more on this).

</p><p>So in the case of Eve, the story goes like this. Eve <i>expresses</i>
the higher-order thought "I was suddenly conscious of the fact that I was
not alone in the house," thereby <i>reporting</i> (truly or falsely) that
she had a certain first-order thought to the effect that she was not alone
in the house. Did she? We'll have to look at our record of what went on
in her brain at the relevant time. Hmm, sure enough, here's a brain event
that had the content (roughly): "Who's there!?!?!" That's close enough.
We confirm her report, in this case. But we might not have confirmed it.
We might have found circumstantial evidence to the effect that Eve has
rationalized the whole event, and wasn't the least bit driven, at the relevant
time, by contents concerning the presence of others. Some of this evidence
might be our secret videotape of her externally visible behavior at the
time. (We see her humming contentedly throughout the relevant period, right
up to the time when she answered the phone and began answering our questions
about her recent phenomenology. There is no sign of apprehension, no abrupt
change of trajectory, and the record of heartrate and skin conductance
shows no alarm.) But we might actually get some even better (because closer
to the gist of her self-report) evidence from our neurocryptography unit,
which, applying the intentional stance to Eve's brain-parts, has tentatively
identified a homunculus whose duties include signalling a general fire
drill whenever it detects the presence of another--it's hooked up to the
vertical symmetry detector in the vision system, for instance (<i>CE</i>,
p.179). That's the sort of story I had in mind. And it uses the intentional-stance
theory of content all the way in.

</p><p>At one point [p.9], Baker wonders what I would conclude if "the neuroscientist
could find no brain state or process with which to identify the putatively
conscious belief." And she says either alternative would leave half of
my project in the lurch. It's worse than that: paraphrasing the physicists
who were confronted with the non-magnet (if that's what it was) I'd have
a much worse problem than which half of my project to cling to. I'd be
worried that my whole project was on the verge of collapse. But she is
right that in this terrible eventuality, I'd cling to the intentional stance
aspect (which I <i>know</i> works very well) and do my best to explain
why so many people have so many false beliefs about what is going on in
their minds. Why would I be so eager to show that people <i>were mistaken</i>
in these beliefs? Because my whole worldview resists as an utterly last
resort any alternative explanation--e.g., a frankly dualistic explanation--of
these undeniably real patterns. To pursue the parallel, suppose we can't
confirm any of the peoples' stories about satanic cult abuse. No physical
evidence of the events reported can be found. What would we do then? We
would try to show that these folks, however sincere in their reports, were
just wrong. But if the pattern defied that diagnosis, as it might, in principle,
we'd have to start toying with the idea that the satanic ritual abuse <i>happened
in another dimension</i> or some other equally extravagant departure from
conservative physics and metaphysics. We're talking seriously spooky last
resorts, folks!

</p><p><b>Stephen Webb</b>'s dexterous navigation of the shoals of Plan One
and the various Passes is largely for nought, since it misconstrues the
intentional stance in a different way. It overlooks a key feature of the
intentional stance: one is allowed to revise one's attributions in the
light of falsified predictions. As soon as one hears the professor's surprising
(in the circumstances) words, one revises the attribution: she must not
have seen her keys, one easily concludes. So behavioral evidence has all
along been front and center in the intentional stance. What is the heterophenomenological
method, after all, but an application of this obvious principle? One patiently
gathers behavioral evidence (largely but not entirely verbal behavioral
evidence), hypothesizing interpretations and refining one's attributions
until, in the limit, they account for ("predict," make sense of) all the
behavior. The standard limit myth may be invoked: the beliefs and desires
(and other intentional states) of an intentional system are those that
would be attributed to it by an ideal observer with a God's-eye-point-of-view.
Prediction and retrodiction are all one to the intentional stance, which
explains as it attributes. It would not be a very useful stance if it couldn't
be harnessed reliably for real-time prediction, but after-the-fact explanation
of behavior is hardly off limits to it, and the behavior itself is obviously
a main source of evidence.

</p><p>Webb patiently tries to corral me at various other choice points, overlooking
reasons I have already given for resisting his alternatives. Much of what
I have said above in response to <b>McLaughli</b>n and <b>O'Leary-Hawthorne</b>,
and <b>Baker</b>, applies here as well. To reiterate: The skin is not that
important as a boundary, as Skinner famously conceded (with my concurrence),
so "internal" behavior is in principle not off limits to the interpretive
exercise, and it can, in particular cases, crucially supplement the stock
of relevant data, but it gets interpreted by the same rules as behavior
outside the skin: the carton of cigarettes listed on the scrap of paper
has the same evidentiary status as the carton of cigarettes referred to
by some cerebral shopping list, if and when science can discern it. I have
pointed out that the line between the design stance and the intentional
stance is not sharp in any case; sub-personal cognitive psychology is a
design stance enterprise conducted with the aid of liberal intentional
stance characterizations of homunculi.

</p><p><i>4.<a name="Superficialism"></a>Superficialism vs. Hysterical
Realism</i>

</p><p>. [Save the phenomena.]

</p><p>--Plato

</p><p>Save the surface and you save all.

</p><p>--Sherwin-Williams

</p><p>Thus Quine opens his <i>Pursuit of Truth</i> (1990). <b>Georges Rey</b>
is surely right that the key to the profound disagreements he and other
Fodorians have with me is that I espouse a view he deftly labels "superficialism."
Who would ever want to be called a superficialist? Well, Quine, for one,
might not shrink from the label. One good term deserves another. In the
past I've called Fodor an "industrial strength realist" but the connotations
of that term are all too positive, and I think Rey's blithe self-description
as a "commonsense" realist is amusingly belied by the convolutions of doctrine
he presents to us, so I'll change the epithet. Rey is an advocate of <i>hysterical
realism</i>. Now you can choose: which would you rather be, a hysterical
realist or a superficialist like me?

</p><p>Rey is far from being alone when he responds to the siren song of hysterical
realism. The defense of what Richard Rorty mockingly calls "Our Realist
Intuitions" is a fervent activity in many quarters, and while I am not
hereby endorsing Rorty's brand of resistance, I do think he has touched
one of the untouchable sore spots in contemporary philosophy. Hysterical
realism <a href="http://cogprints.org/280/1/getreal.htm#16.">Endnote 16</a> deserves its name, I will argue,
because it is an overreaction, a rationally unmotivatable spasm brought
on by peering into the abyss of certain indeterminacies that really should
not trouble anybody so much.

</p><p>For Rey the particular topic is consciousness, a contentious topic,
but we can begin cautiously. I trust we can all agree on this much: we
find people asking questions about consciousness, using ordinary language,
of course, with its ordinary presuppositions enshrined. Then once we start
examining the real, causal complexities of what happens in brains, we find,
I claim, a strikingly poor match between the pre-theoretical presuppositions
and the messy details. Here is another place where a disagreement over
empirical facts looms large. Those who have not looked very closely are
apt to think that I am exaggerating when I claim that this is a serious
theoretical impasse. But since this isn't the place to review the empirical
details, let's just suppose for the sake of argument that I am not exaggerating.
Faced, then, with the striking <i>non</i>-alignment of everyday talk with
scientific talk, what, as philosophers, should we do? My view, "superficialism,"
holds that we should relax our grip on the conviction that our everyday
terms <i>must</i> find application--one application or another--in any
acceptable solution. There may be, I say, no fact of the matter of just
which events are--to use the ordinary term--conscious, and which are not
(in the rather special cases raised by the Orwell vs. Stalin impasse).
Fie! Scandalous irrealism! Verificationism!

</p><p>Rey exposes my position with thorough scholarship. He relentlessly tracks
down virtually all the points of confrontation, and he has organized the
whole in proper marching order. Time and again as I read his essay, I found
myself thinking "but I've dealt with that" only to turn the page and find
the very passage I had in mind duly cited and discussed. There is one exception.
To advert to what may be the only relevant passage in my work Rey doesn't
discuss, the situation with regard to consciousness is like that confronted
by the theorists who are asked what <i>fatigues</i> are (<i>Brainstorms</i>,
p.xix-xx). The natives in this imaginary land, you may recall, have a curious
doctrine of "fatigues"--too many fatigues spoil your aim, a fatigue in
the legs is worth two in the arms, and Mommy, where do fatigues go when
I sleep? We modern scientists arrive in their midst and they ask us to
solve their traditional mysteries about fatigues. The hysterical realist
takes on the thankless task of finding something real in the body to declare
to be the fatigues so favored by the local folk. And I say "Gimme a break!
We <i>already know</i> enough about fatigues to know that they are not
a good category for precision science; you simply cannot motivate a realist
theory of fatigues. There's nothing left to discover that could be relevant
to what the <i>right</i> theory of fatigues would be." That is superficialism,
by definition, but the question remains: Is this in fact a superficial
response? Does it fall prey, as Rey suggests, to my own charge of mistaking
a failure of imagination for an insight into necessity?

</p><p>I say that we already know enough empirical facts about what consciousness
<i>isn't</i> to know that the ordinary concept of consciousness, like the
concept of fatigues, is too frail; it could never be turned into the sort
of scientific concept that could wring answers to the currently unanswerable
questions. On the contrary, says the hysterical realist, we can dimly imagine
that science will someday uncover grounds, currently unsuspected or even
unimaginable by us, for settling such questions as the Orwell vs. Stalin
question, or the question of whether some subset of human beings might
turn out to be zombies after all, etc. "Never say never," is the advice
offered by Owen Flanagan (1992, p. 14-15).

</p><p>I'm all for open-mindedness and scientific optimism, but surely Rey,
Flanagan, and the others would agree that there are <i>some</i> occasions
when the jig is up--when it is just silly to hold out hope for such a scientific
revelation. Consider Einsteinian physics. Einstein noted that it is impossible
to distinguish by local observation between a gravitational field and an
accelerated frame of reference. This led him to postulate the equivalence
that is at the heart of relativity theory. Now insert the "realist," who
says "Oh just because you can't distinguish the two doesn't mean they aren't
different! There might be a difference that is indistinguishable by any
current test! Never say never!" Yeah, there might be, but in the meantime,
tremendous progress is made by concluding that there isn't (Cf. Field,
1974, 1975). I am proposing similar simplifications: since you can't distinguish
between the Orwellian and Stalinesque models of meta-contrast, or between
a zombie that acts just as if its conscious and a conscious being, they
are equivalent.

</p><p>If Rey <i>et al</i>. agree with me that the superficialist response
is sometimes appropriate, the question that divides us is whether the empirical
facts support consciousness being such an instance. I say yes, and what
some philosophers don't appreciate is that when I say this, I'm not just
putting forward a philosophical thesis meant to ride piggy-back on whatever
the current scientific consensus might be. I'm making a fairly bold proposal
about empirical theory in cognitive neuroscience, and basing it on a fairly
detailed analysis of a wide variety of experimental and theoretical results.
The Multiple Drafts Model is deliberately sketchy about many details, but
it is a scientific model, not just a philosophical toy.

</p><p>Rey sketches his alternative, the CCC theory of consciousness, and suggests
that in many regards I could go along with his way of speaking--all my
multiple drafts being carried along as sentences of LOT in all his registers.
And he acknowledges that his theory will have to be--shall we say--innovative
in the way it settles many of the issues left open in the traditional understanding.
But he imagines that there might be good scientific reasons in favor of
such innovations, though of course he can't now say what they might be.
This is one place where I think he has clearly underestimated the grounds
I have given for my view. It is in the details of the account of the problems
about time that the incoherence of Cartesian materialism emerges, and when
Rey says that the problems of so-called temporal anomaly can be "easily
sorted out" by a three-fold distinction in his CCC theory, his optimism
counts for nothing till we see just how this is to be accomplished when
he turns his philosophical theory into a scientific theory with some detail.<a href="http://cogprints.org/280/1/getreal.htm#17.">Endnote
17</a> <b>David Rosenthal</b> takes the first few steps of this project
in his own attempt to describe a possible brain mechanism that could resolve
the Orwell-Stalin issue, and arrives at the conclusion that his mechanism
"blurs the contrast between Stalinesque and Orwellian. . . There is reason,
therefore, to be suspicious of a hard and fast distinction between Stalinesque
and Orwellian mechanisms." [p.21] (More about this later.) Rey admits he
hasn't a clue whether Orwell or Stalin would prevail in his CCC theory,
but sees no reason "to leap to the conclusion" that there is no fact of
the matter. My claim was no leap; it was brought home by a careful examination
of the possibilities. <a href="http://cogprints.org/280/1/getreal.htm#18.">Endnote 18</a>

</p><p>(This is a good opportunity to point out that Flanagan's discussion
similarly underestimates the difficulties raised by the Multiple Drafts
Model. He cites (p.15-16) the Logothetis and Schall experiment with macaques,
but it is systematically inconclusive: Suppose we find that the activity
in the STS region in macaques (parallel to MT in the human cortex) is also
found in human subjects who deny awareness of the shift to which the macaques
have been trained to respond, while making some other behavioral indication
(e.g., a saccade) that they have detected the shift? Would this be evidence
showing that MT activity was not, after all, associated with consciousness?
Flanagan overlooks my discussion of the issue:

</p><p>There is a region in the cortex called MT, which responds to motion
(and apparent motion). Suppose then that some activity in MT <i>is</i>
the brain's concluding that there was . . . motion. There is no further
question, on the Multiple Drafts model, of whether this is a pre-experiential
or post-experiential conclusion. It would be a mistake to ask, in other
words, whether the activity in MT was a "reaction to a conscious experience"
. . . as opposed to a "decision to represent motion" [in conscious experience].
(<i>CE</i>, p.128n)

</p><p>And it is interesting to note that Logothetis and Schall themselves
acknowledge the gap, and do not attempt to close it:

</p><p>The interpretation of the results is by no means conclusive. The differential
modulation of these STS neurons in response to rivalrous stimuli was evident
much earlier than subjects typically resolve the rivalrous perception.
Thus further processing is clearly involved, and the data do not exclude
the possibility that the perception-related modulation observed in these
neurons may be a result of feedback from higher centers. (Logothetis and
Schall, 1989)

</p><p>What would closing the gap entail? It would entail singling out some
privileged corner-turning as the one that the <i>conscious subject</i>
presided over or witnessed, but there is no such inner sanctum for such
events to happen in. Flanagan has jumped to conclusions about the proper
heterophenomenology of the macaques and its relation to activity in STS,
begging the question.

</p><p>Flanagan also speculates that either 40-herz synchrony or the Squire
Zola-Morgan theory of hippocampal involvement might provide the leverage
to resolve the quandaries I say are unresolvable, but these two popular
themes are already tidily tucked in among the factors that are powerless
to settle the questions, as a careful examination shows. (See, for instance,
Jeffrey Gray's forthcoming article in BBS, presenting his model of the
role of the hippocampus in consciousness, and my commentary, "Overworking
the hippocampus.") Until you work through the details, it is indeed hard
to see that these ideas utterly fail to provide any further leverage on
the Orwell-Stalin question. And if they can't help, what could? It is no
use just saying "Well, I can't imagine anything <i>now</i> that could upset
your claim, but still, something could!")

</p><p>I think there are abundant empirical grounds for eschewing Rey's proposed
way of speaking about "registers" in the brain containing various sentences
in a language of thought, but I'll go along with the gag this far: <i>if</i>
Rey could motivate a categorization of all these registers into c-registers
and u-registers, I would grant that he could thereupon handily discover,
by brute inspection, facts of the matter where I say there are none. Some
of these might turn out to be mighty strange facts--it could turn out that
lefthanders aren't conscious after all, or that the order in which successive
perceived events become conscious in subjects is seldom if ever the order
in which they seem to subjects to occur, or that people are conscious of
multiple interpretations of every sentence they hear, without realizing
it--but who ever said science couldn't surprise us? But precisely because
such bizarre "discoveries" are not just possible but already upon us, the
demand for a <i>motivation</i> for the proposed identifications is going
to be very, very high. We already know that the tasks that would have to
be normally accomplished by the imagined c-registers are broken up and
distributed around to many different structures, asynchronously making
their particular contributions. Singling out any one variety of these,
or even some salient team of these, and labeling them the c-registers is
going to look awfully <i>ad hoc</i>. Superficialism is attractive whenever
the task of motivating a particular hard line looks hopeless.

</p><p>Hilary Putnam's classic paper, "Dreaming and Depth Grammar" 1962, did
a number on superficialism from which it has never, till now, recovered.
Norman Malcolm and the other mavens of ordinary language philosophy had
raised their brand of "conceptual analysis" to a deeply regressive, hyperconservative,
pitch. Science, it seemed, could never discover anything that the Folk
didn't already know about <i>their</i> phenomena. If science discovered
anything truly surprising, it would have to be <i>about something else</i>--"you've
changed the concept," as the saying went. Putnam showed how lamentably
thin this philosophy of language was (see also Dennett, 1968), but I think
the pendulum has swung too far. Used in moderation, the superficialist
response to mismatches between folk psychology and academic psychology
(like the mismatch between folk physiology --"fatigues"--and scientific
physiology) is just the ticket.

</p><p>Ordinary folk think that dreams are experiences that occur during sleep.
Suppose science were to discover that the content-fixing series of neural
events that generate the stories people tell on waking actually occur,
unbeknownst to their subjects, during waking life. At this very minute,
let's suppose, your brain is composing ("having"?) the dream you will report
on waking tomorrow. Now in this imagined eventuality, "what would we say?"
Would we say "It turns out that dreams aren't experiences after all" or
would we say "It turns out that there aren't any dreams at all" or what?
The superficialist about dreams says that this may be an interesting question
but it is not a question of discovery, but one of policy, just like the
fatigues case--or the magnets case. The hysterical realist says that it
all depends on what the scientists have learned. If there is a deep enough
theory (we can't imagine it now, of course), there could be conclusive
grounds for the claim that scientists had <i>discovered</i> that dreams
happen while you're awake, and are not experiences at all. But, says Malcolm,
rising from the grave, now you're just <i>changing the concept</i>. You
have discovered a scientific truth, but not a truth <i>about dreams</i>.
The concept of a dream may not be a good scientific concept, but it is
our very own. He would say the same about the alternative claim--the scientists
had discovered that there simply were no dreams after all. Eliminativism
about dreams is as myopic and needlessly tendentious as proclaiming the
weird identification. The main point, in any event, is that if dreams (as
ordinarily understood) turned out not to have a good fit with scientific
discoveries, then it would be a gratuitous exercise in special pleading
to try to force one scientific identification of dreams or another; whatever
we decided was best to say, our decision would not be a scientific discovery,
but a more or less political decision about how best to avoid misunderstandings.

</p><p>It must count against any novel scientific recategorization of an ordinary
term that it creates huge dislocations of common understanding (dolphins
turn out not to be fish, but when we are told that tomatoes are fruit,
not vegetables, we blithely conclude that scientists have some <i>other</i>,
technical concept of fruit in mind, not the ordinary one). That's just
a point about language--a close kin to Quine on the constraints on radical
translation, and also, as Rey notes, to Malcolm and Wittgenstein on "changing
the concept." <a href="http://cogprints.org/280/1/getreal.htm#19.">Endnote 19</a> Putnam is commonly thought
to have put a stop to this line of thought, not just in his trouncing of
Malcolm, but in his more recent insistence (1975) that, thanks to the division
of linguistic labor, natural kinds can be what people are <i>really</i>
talking about, even when, as individuals, they are incompetent to discriminate
between alternative possibilities. The fundamental idea is that we can
escape our local epistemological limitations by ceding our referential
authority to Nature itself: What I mean (whether I know it or not) by my
own word "water" is <i>whatever natural kind</i> the stuff I paradigmatically
call "water" turns out to be. This is a fine idea when Nature cooperates--or
rather, to put the responsibility where it belongs, when our linguistic
community happens to have hit the nail on the head (or close enough). But
whenever our everyday terms carve Nature less well (in spite of our Putnamian
goal of naming natural kinds) there is no forcing the issue.

</p><p>It is thus the over-extension of Putnam's doctrine of natural kinds
that is a bulwark of hysterical realism, an attempt to turn the nominal
essences of science into real essences (Dennett, 1995). This comes out
clearly if we contrast a case in which Putnam's doctrine looks plausible
with one that does not look compelling at all. Suppose Twin Earth is just
like Earth except for having shmust where we have dust--behind the books
on the bookcase, along country roads during dry spells, etc. But surely,
you protest, the concept of <i>dust</i> isn't the concept of a natural
kind--shmust <i>is</i> dust, in spite of what anybody says! Exactly. It's
a superficial concept, a nominal essence of scant interest or power. We
already know enough about dust to know that science couldn't discover that
dust was really something else--or that there wasn't any dust. Science
could not uncover the secret nature of dust, because dust <i>qua dust</i>
couldn't have a secret nature. In contrast, we already know enough about
water, and gold, to know that they <i>are</i> natural kinds.

</p><p>The question then that divides Rey and me might seem to be: are the
concepts of folk psychology like the concept of dust, or like the concept
of water? Rey thinks they are like the concept of water, good candidates
for natural kindhood. I think we already know enough about many of them
to know that even though they may aspire to name natural kinds (unlike
the concept of dust), they aren't good enough to succeed. That is a difference
of opinion arising from different readings of the empirical facts, but
there is also an underlying philosophical disagreement. Rey, as a hysterical
realist, thinks there is always the further question to be answered: which
natural kinds do our terms <i>in fact</i> name?

</p><p>This question cannot be forced, since natural kinds can be nested, an
undeniable fact (though Putnamians have ignored it for years) that leads
us right back to superficialism. Consider Putnam's standard case of water.
Presumably, H2O and XYZ are subkinds of some larger natural kind. Putnam
disguises this implication by calling his alternative "XYZ" and not, say,
"X2O," which we would be more inclined to consider a novel variety of water,
like D20, deuterium oxide or heavy water.<a href="http://cogprints.org/280/1/getreal.htm#20.">Endnote 20</a>
How could H20 and XYZ not be instances of some single natural kind, given
that they are as interchangeable in the physical world as Putnam requires
us to imagine? Suppose, then, that H20 and XYZ are both instances of some
broader natural kind, K. Which natural kind did the folk mean by their
pre-scientific word "water"? Since they lacked any scientific purchase
on the difference between H20 and K, and could not, <i>ex hypothesi</i>,
distinguish them, there cannot have been grounds in their usage or understanding
for favoring one over the other. Might we invoke a "general principle"
to the effect that whenever people use a term with the understanding that
it names a natural kind, they mean the term to refer to the narrowest natural
kind that fits their historical usage? We might, but the arbitrariness
of the principle will haunt us in cases in which isolation forces bizarrely
narrow answers. <a href="http://cogprints.org/280/1/getreal.htm#21.">Endnote 21</a>For instance, if there is
life anywhere in the universe that is not carbon-based, such life forms
could not be called "alive" by unscientific earthlings, since the only
life forms that have ever been called alive on this planet are exclusively
carbon-based, and carbon-based life is surely a natural kind. Adopting
the proposed repair to Putnamian doctrine, we would have to say that anyone
who called a Martian alive would be making the same mistake as the person
who called a glass of XYZ water. Not very persuasive.

</p><p>So if we abandon the minimalist principle as arbitrary and unmotivatable,
we are left with two choices: either there is a fact of the matter, but
one that is systematically indiscernible from every possible perspective
(now that's truly hysterical realism!), or there is no fact of the matter--it's
a policy question at best--and we are back at superficialism. Try it. You'll
like it. I find it a lot easier to swallow than hysterical realism.

</p><p><i><a name="Otto"></a>Otto and the Zombies</i>

</p><p>As<b> Joseph Levine</b> says, "it's terribly difficult to get clear
about just what is being affirmed and denied" in the qualia debate. His
response is to meet my case against qualia with a methodical, sympathetic
and accurate rebuttal, very usefully shining light on the issues from the
other side. It might seem at first as if his botanizing of species of bold
and modest qualophilia, reductionism and eliminativism is an indictment
of the whole enterprise, showing it to be one more instance of philosophers
playing burden tennis instead of engaging in a serious investigation. His
use of the common philosophical diction of "available strategies" belies
the fact that for him, as for me, the point in the end isn't to win, but
to uncover the truth. Let me try to reframe the issue slightly. We begin
as people with opposing hunches--it's as simple as that--and neither side
knows <i>just</i> what to say. One side feels pretty uncomfortable with
the prospect of a materialistic account of subjectivity, and the other
side is pretty sure all the <i>real</i> problems with such a theory can
be worked out. So they put their heads together (face to face and opposed),
and see what happens. Strong moves by one side (e.g., "bold qualophilia")
are readily rebuffed--not refuted once and for all, but made to seem gratuitous
or extravagant, worth putting on the back burner for awhile if not abandoned
utterly--while more modest forays are explored. Out of this actually quite
constructive interplay of opposing hunches, genuine progress is made, or
can be made.

</p><p>It is important to recognize this interplay or dialectic, for otherwise
it can seem as if people are always talking past each other--or worse:
deliberately attempting to confound the opposition. <b>Robert Van Gulick</b>,
for instance, describes my method in the following terms: "like any good
debater, he tries to saddle the opposition with as much questionable philosophical
baggage as possible." [ms p6] That would not be a constructive move on
my part, and I sincerely hope I haven't done that. Let's leave debating
tricks to the debaters. What I have <i>tried</i> to do is to show that
the "questionable philosophical baggage" comes along for the ride under
surprisingly innocent-seeming circumstances. I can see how my arguing that
somebody's apparently innocent "realism" or "mild qualophilia" had embarrassing
implications might look like a debater's trick to somebody on the receiving
end, but if that were all it was, it should not be admired or even tolerated;
it should be dismissed as unhelpful and unserious shenanigans. It has seemed
to some as if I am shooting down strawmen with arguments against (only)
bold qualophilia, when in fact I aim some arguments--appropriately--against
the bold views and others--appropriately--against the modest views. This
comes out clearly in Levine's deft peeling of the onion, as he follows
me down the path to what he considers Otto's "trap," acknowledging--and
explaining--how each move on his side is neatly countered by a move on
my part.

</p><p>I will return to Otto, and Levine's attempt to escape with an intact
view, in a moment, but first I want to highlight a feature of the interplay
that comes out intermittently in Levine's discussion, but to which he does
not draw explicit attention. This is what we might call unrecognized allegiances.
In this phenomenon, people on one side or the other explicitly disavow
any allegiance to a strong view as soon as a good objection to it is pressed,
thereby allowing themselves to concede without further examination that
the other side's arguments would indeed demolish <i>that</i> strawman,
but precisely because they never bother to defend the strong view, they
fail to see just how much they are giving up--and giving up for good--as
they move to the more modest and defensible versions. Then they later unwittingly
revert to an appeal to some feature that belongs only to the strong view,
and we go round and round in circles. I believe this problem of unrecognized
allegiances is a common foible, and one of my countermeasures is to set
up vivid reminders of what one is renouncing--<i>never to return</i>. Figment,
for instance. It <i>is</i> an attractive feature to qualophiles until I
find a suitably abusive way of characterizing it, and I am always gratified
when some brave qualophile admits that, yes, something along the lines
of figment as <i>just</i> what she was hankering for. Well, you can't have
it. Figment doesn't properly <i>come up</i>, of course, in discussions
with modest qualophiles, who have officially renounced such extravagances,
but without the frontal attack on it, it would, I am sure, continue to
fuel the motivation of some modest qualophiles behind the scenes.

</p><p>On his journey to Otto, Levine acutely describes the challenge of heterophenomenology,
and sees that the only escape for qualophiles is to maintain "that conscious
experiences themselves, not merely our verbal judgments about them, are
the primary data to which a theory must answer." [p.15] Leopold Stubenberg
(1995) has seen the same cliff-edge looming, and resisted in the same terms.
Here is my response (and note that its force is somewhat acknowledged,
at various points, in Levine's discussion): You defenders of the first-person
point of view are not entitled to this complaint about the "primary data"
of heterophenomenology, since <i>by your own lights</i>, you should prefer
its treatment of the primary data to any other. Why? Because it manifestly
does justice to both possible sources of non-overlap. On the one hand,
if some of your conscious experiences occur unbeknownst to you (they are
experiences about which you have no beliefs, and hence can make no "verbal
judgments"), then they are just as inaccessible to your first-person point
of view as they are to heterophenomenology. <i>Ex hypothesi</i>, you don't
even suspect you have them--if you did, you could verbally express those
suspicions. So heterophenomenology's list of primary data doesn't leave
out any conscious experiences you know of, or have any first-person inklings
about. On the other hand, unless you claim not just reliability or normal
incorrigibility, but outright infallibility, you should admit that some--just
some--of your beliefs (or verbal judgments) about your conscious experiences
might be wrong; in all such cases, however rare they are, what has to be
explained by theory is not the conscious experience, but your belief in
it (or your sincere verbal judgment, etc). So heterophenomenology doesn't
include any spurious "primary data" either, but plays it safe in a way
you should approve. <a href="http://cogprints.org/280/1/getreal.htm#22.">Endnote 22</a>

</p><p>Levine's response to this impasse, like Stubenberg's, takes us right
to Otto, who anticipates it, in his plea for "real seeming". And Levine
notes, correctly I daresay, that if I am right when I say "there is no
difference between being of the heartfelt opinion that something seems
pink to you, and something <i>really seeming</i> pink to you," then there
is "nothing left about which to argue." So we are closing in. (For more
on real seeming, see below.) And it is true, as Levine says, that in my
immediate response to Otto, I don't really argue for this claim; I just
assert it. Elsewhere in the book, however, I do give grounds for believing
it--in my own account of what consciousness comes to, and in my arguments
about what no empirically realistic model of consciousness can tolerate:
a Cartesian Theater. But I surely didn't make it clear enough why those
considerations guaranteed my assertion to Otto on this occasion. Thanks
to Levine, I can now repair that gap, for the issue is exposed with unprecedented
clarity in his attempt to characterize the modest qualophile's "inability
to provide an account of the mechanisms of first-person epistemic access."
[p27]

</p><p>So suppose B is a state of conscious experience. I want to understand
how a cognitive state, A, carries the information that B. It seems that
in order for me to understand that relation, I must first understand how
B is realized in those very physical mechanisms by which the information
that B is to be carried to A. But, by the qualophile's own hypothesis,
this understanding is not currently available. That is, I don't understand
how B is itself realized in physical mechanisms. So, it follows that I
also don't understand how information concerning B <i>flows to A</i> [my
emphasis]. Hence, I don't have an account of first-person epistemic access.
[p.28-9]

</p><p>Think of what lurks in this "flowing to A." There is a (functional)
<i>place</i>, A, which either "has access to" the information that B, or
doesn't. How on earth does the information <i>get there</i>? These are
the terms in which Levine's qualophile frames the issue. But since this
is to be an account of <i>first-person</i> epistemic access, the place
in question must be none other than the place <i>where I reside</i>, the
Cartesian Theater. There is no such place. Any theory which postulates
such a place is still in the grip of Cartesian materialism. What (and where)
is this I? It is not an organ, a subfaculty, a place in the brain, a medium--or
<i>me</i>dium (Dennett, 1993)--into which information gets transduced.
My attack on the Cartesian Theater is among other things an attack on the
very practice--illustrated here in an otherwise remarkably surefooted performance--of
positing an unanalyzed "I" or "we" or "self" or "subject" who "has access"
to <i>x</i> or <i>y</i>, as if we could take this as a primitive of our
theorizing. Any sane account of the mechanisms of consciousness must begin
with the denial of Cartesian materialism; and that leads irresistibly to
the view that the "me" has to be constructed out of the interactions, not
vice versa. This is the point of what I sometimes think is the most important,
and under-appreciated, passage in <i>CE</i>:

</p><p>How do I get to know all about this? How come <i>I</i> can tell you
all about what was going on in my head? The answer to the puzzle is simple:
<i>Because that is what I am</i>. Because a knower and reporter of such
things in such terms is what is me. <i>My </i>existence is explained by
the fact that there are these capacities in this body. (p410)

</p><p>But then what about the zombie problem? Levine is excellent on the zombie
problem. In particular, he shows exactly why, as I have urged, there is
really nothing left of modest qualophilia unless you hang tough on the
conceivability of zombies. So, hanging tough on zombies is just what he
does, with resourcefulness and an acute appreciation of the pitfalls the
qualophobe has prepared for him. I hope no qualophiles find fault with
his treatment, since he seems to me to have captured the dialectic and
strategy of both sides just about perfectly. Certainly he has done justice
to my campaign against zombies--except for one delicate matter, alluded
to in his polemical closing, but not directly addressed. Levine deplores
the defensive position into which qualophiles have been thrust by my attack
on their belief in zombies. No, he says, truly modest qualophilia is not
"a philosophically infantile obsession" and modest qualophiles "practice
their puzzlement in a spirit of profound respect for science." I gather,
in other words, that he finds my ridiculing of the belief in zombies to
be unfair, at best a cheap shot. I confess that try as I might, I cannot
summon up conviction for any other verdict: zombies are <i>ridiculous</i>!

</p><p>By my lights, it is an embarrassment to philosophy that what is widely
regarded among philosophers as a major theoretical controversy should come
down to whether or not zombies (philosophers' zombies) are possible/conceivable.
I myself try hard to avoid the issue, and the term, in discussions of consciousness
with scientists, since I invariably find that any attempt at serious discussion
of the zombie problem meets with ill-suppressed hilarity. This does philosophy
and philosophers no good, and I deplore it just as much as Levine does.
Clearly a massive public relations job needs to be done, and just as clearly
I am not the one to attempt it, since I myself don't yet see how a philosopher
as acute and surefooted and wise as Levine can stomach the position he
staunchly maintains about zombies. I have helped drive him there, thinking
the campaign would cure him. If he chooses instead to <i>outsmart</i> <a href="http://cogprints.org/280/1/getreal.htm#23.">Endnote
23</a> me, then perhaps he himself should take on the delicate task of
explaining <i>to a general audience</i>, not to philosophers, why the belief
in zombies is not a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>. His paper in this volume
is a fine foundation, but it is still manifestly written for a philosophical
audience, and even in it, he fails (in my biased opinion) to secure much
of a leg for a zombie to stand on. But on the strength of his showing here,
he can do it if anybody can.

</p><p>I responded above to <b>Robert Van Gulick</b>'s suggestion that I was
cleverly trying "to saddle the opposition with as much questionable philosophical
baggage as possible," by denying that this was a debater's trick on my
part. Now it is time to address the substantive issue: can one be a phenomenal
realist (in Van Gulick's sense) without taking on the bad baggage? I have
said no, but he is not convinced. His paper usefully clarifies the conditions
under which one can be a phenomenal realist, in his sense, but in the process
it seems to me that he ends up with a position that is scarcely distinguishable
from mine after all. He thinks, for instance, that Marcel Kinsbourne's
"integrated field" theory might be a good empirical fleshing out of his
phenomenal realism, but Kinsbourne's theory and mine are one and the same;
we worked it out in collaboration, and so far as I know we do not part
company--except by inadvertence or forgetfulness--on any of the issues,
differing only in which aspects of the shared theory to emphasize at various
moments. What keeps Kinsbourne and me from being phenomenal realists too,
then?

</p><p>Phenomenal realists believe there are important structural and functional
differences between mental states with phenomenal properties and those
without. . . . Phenomenal states for example seem to play an especially
privileged role in the initiation of intentional behavior . . . On the
structural side phenomenal states typically involve highly integrated representations
that incorporate multi-modal information and rich network<b>[s?-editor
check ms]</b> of connections among interrelated items in the represented
scene or situation. [p.17]

</p><p>Kinsbourne and I certainly agree about the importance to consciousness
of these "structural and functional differences," which is why they each
get special treatment in the Multiple Drafts Model (e.g., the discussions
of blindsight, "hide the thimble," and prosthetic vision in <i>CE</i>).
But what work are "phenomenal properties" doing over and above the role
played by the integration and the rich network? Kinsbourne and I wonder
what we can be supposed to be leaving out. We insist upon the functional
and structural differences, and on their importance. I go on to say, wearing
my philosopher's hat, that these features are the very features typically
misdescribed by philosophers as somehow "phenomenal."

</p><p>What difference are we disagreeing about? Perhaps this one (leaning
on the usual crutch): Kinsbourne and I would see no reason in principle
why a robot (like the proverbial zombie that lacks phenomenal consciousness)
could not exhibit <i>both sides</i> of the distinctions observable in blindsight--being
unable to initiate or guide intentional actions by benefiting from the
information in its scotoma, while showing the normal responsiveness, etc.,
to the visual information gleaned from the rest of its visual field. If
so, then the difference could not, <i>ex hypothesi</i>, be a difference
in phenomenal consciousness, the robot having none under the best of conditions.
Would phenomenal realists dig in their heels here, and if so, how? Would
they insist that no robot could have highly integrated, action-initiating
vision? A daring and implausible empirical claim. Would they insist that
any robot that did exhibit normal visual competence would show <i>ipso
facto</i> that robots have phenomenal consciousness after all? That would
be a clarification or revision of the meaning of "phenomenal consciousness"
that would put Kinsbourne and me squarely in the camp of the phenomenal
realists (see my discussion of Cog, in the first section of this essay).
A third possibility is that the phenomenal realist would declare that in
the case of such a robot, we wouldn't know (from all we've been told so
far) whether this robot had, or didn't have, phenomenal consciousness to
go along with its (otherwise) normal vision. But then what has happened
to the importance of phenomenal properties? What leg would they then stand
on?

</p><p>There is one window through which the presumed difference can be clearly
seen. Van Gulick thinks he has shown that

</p><p>. . . there can be facts of the matter about experience that cannot
be empirically detected. There may be a briefly transient fact about how
experience is for the subject, but if the duration of that experience is
insufficient to fix a belief or generate a report it will systematically
elude detection.[ms p16]

</p><p>Kinsbourne and I opened our joint paper by quoting a sentence from Ariel
Dorfman's novel, <i>Mascara</i>, that was supposed to exhibit the dubiousness
of this assumption:

</p><p>I'm really not sure if others fail to perceive me or if, one fraction
of a second after my face interferes with their horizon, a millionth of
a second after they have cast their gaze on me, they already begin to wash
me from their memory: forgotten before arriving at the scant, sad archangel
of a remembrance.

</p><p>In my discussion of Rosenthal and Block, below, I will respond further
to his claim.

</p><p><i>6.&nbsp;<a name="Higher Order"></a>Higher Order Thoughts and Mental
Blocks</i>

</p><p><b>David Rosenthal</b> and <b>Ned Block</b> are both unpersuaded by
the radical implications of my Multiple Drafts Model of consciousness,
and their essays deal with many of the same issues, but they take opposite
approaches to the task confronting them. Rosenthal looks closely at the
MDM and attempts to show how to sever its connections to its most disturbing
feature, "first-person operationalism" (FPO), in the process very usefully
highlighting the reasons I have found for uniting them. Block, in contrast,
turns his back on the details of the MDM, thereby confirming the folk wisdom
that if you don't look at something, you can't see it.

</p><p>Rosenthal, like <b>Dretske</b>, tries to establish something like a
medium of representation (of "sensory content") midway between stimulation
and the sort of (mis-)taking that is constitutive of how it seems (in at
least one sense). They are both trying to find a home for what I call real
seeming, in short. And once again, Rosenthal directly confronts a problem
that is being underestimated by others. In his discussion of "Hide the
Thimble," he notes that there is a <i>prima facie</i> problem with any
view that insists, contrary to Betsy's first-person disavowals, that a
"sensation" of the thimble is somehow part of her consciousness. As he
observes, "such a sensation could, it seems, be conscious only in some
technical sense that lacks any implications about our intuitive conception
of consciousness." 13. But he also notes that "Theories often expand our
ability to discriminate among phenomena that we cannot discriminate by
other means," [p.11] echoing the positive thinking of Owen Flanagan and
<b>Georges Rey</b>. True, but as I have stressed in my discussion of them,
we have to be able to motivate the extension of the theory. Rosenthal recognizes
this burden, and claims that the apparent <i>adhoc</i>ness of any such
theory extension is removed by reflection on the existence of "fleeting
auditory and visual sensations that occupy the periphery of our attention."
[p.14] Are we in fact <i>conscious</i> of any such fleeting auditory and
visual sensations? It certainly seems so. We know that they are there,
it seems, since although we can never quite catch them individually in
the net of recollection, if they weren't there, we'd notice their absence.
(Whatever we catch in the net of recollection is always, <i>ipso facto</i>,
something picked out by attention, something the existence of which is
known to us in the manner Dretske calls fact awareness.) But would we <i>in
fact</i> notice their absence if they weren't "there"? The experiments
by Grimes and Rensink <i>et al.</i> show that we don't notice huge differences
"in them," and the existence of such counter-intuitive pathologies as Anton's
Syndrome (people who have become totally blind but don't yet realize it!)
show that our everyday intuitions about these matters are not to be trusted.
In what interesting sense does the occurrence of these putative "fleeting
sensations" register <i>on us</i> at all? Rosenthal thinks he can slip
between Scylla and Charybdis here: "All that's necessary for that to happen
is a momentary event of being transitively conscious of the sensation,
albeit too briefly to register as part of the subject's first-person point
of view." [p.14] But why speak of transitive <i>consciousness</i> here
at all, if it leaves the first-person point of view unaffected? <a href="http://cogprints.org/280/1/getreal.htm#24.">Endnote
24</a> What is called for (by both Dretske and Rosenthal) is some form
of ephemeral effect on some informational medium in the brain. That is
easily found, in abundance: the brief irradiation of one's retinas by the
thimble's image should do the trick, or the equally brief modification
of V1, the "first" visual area of the cortex. We could say, then, that
people have transitory transitive consciousness (thing awareness, in Dretske's
terms) of any stimuli whose image irradiates the retinas and/or modifies
V1. Why not? Because, once again, you can't <i>motivate</i> the claim that
any such medium counts as the medium of consciousness (Mangan, 1993), or
the claim that such transitory modification counts as <i>seeing</i> (Dretske),
or that the units composing such a medium count as the c-registers (Rey).

</p><p>Rosenthal's deliberate re-expression of my MDM leaving out FPO forces
him to encounter from a different angle the problems that led me to incorporate
FPO into my account. At one point, describing the Orwellian option, he
says: "In this sequence, the initial stimulus did reach consciousness .
. . but that conscious sensation didn't last long enough to have any noticeable
mental effects; it commanded no attention, and when it ceased all memory
of it was expunged." [p.8] Making sense of such a claim requires one to
have some theory or model of consciousness that permits the normal mental
effects of consciousness to be gathered, as it were, into a family under
some tolerant umbrella, so that getting under the umbrella counts, even
if one goes on to achieve few, if any, of the normal effects. <a href="http://cogprints.org/280/1/getreal.htm#25.">Endnote
25</a> But not all phenomena are amenable to such treatment. Fame is my
favorite exception (Dennett, forthcoming a). Consider the parallel claim,
made about somebody: "In his life, he did achieve fame, but that fame didn't
last long enough to have any noticeable effects in the world; he commanded
no attention, and when he died, all memory of him was expunged." What on
earth could this mean? Unless it meant something "technical" and unmotivated,
along the lines of "he was inducted into some Hall of Fame" the claim just
contradicts itself.

</p><p>Rosenthal attempts to rehabilitate real seeming by discovering several
different levels of seeming. He shows how to drive a wedge between the
"second level" seeming of the first-person point of view as constituted
by heterophenomenology and a "first level" variety of seeming, which would
be revealed by such phenomena as somebody swerving to avoid a truck, without
that truck entering their heterophenomenological worlds. This distinction
is real enough, a descendant of my distinction (<i>Content and Consciousness</i>,
1969) between awareness1 and awareness2, now abandoned because I saw that
instead of there being sharp levels of seeming, there was something more
blurry, something more like a continuum, as revealed most vividly in Marcel's
experiment requiring subjects to make multiple "redundant" responses to
the same stimulus (<i>CE</i>, p248). Normally, all the responses of a person
(or animal) pull together in favor of one reading of how things seem "to"
that unitary agent, but in pathological or just extreme circumstances,
the "transcendental unity" of seeming can come apart. When it does, we
are not entitled to assume that some still unidentified property of consciousness
(a "player to be named later") belongs to some subset of the seemings.
Rosenthal recognizes this, in part: he allows me the category of unconscious
seemings (what, in the old days, I would have called cases of awareness2
without awareness1), but in spite of his several recognitions of the onset
of blurriness in his own account as he develops the details, he persists
in holding out for a sharp divide between the unconscious and the conscious,
and he persists in trying to make the divide distinct from the brutally
incisive rule of first-person operationalism: if the subject can't report
it, it isn't part of the subject's consciousness.

</p><p>Heterophenomenological reports give us our best evidence about how people's
conscious mental lives appear to them. But things aren't always as they
seem. So Dennett's methodological appeal to these reports is neutral about
whether they describe the <i>conscious</i> [emphasis added] events that
constitute a subject's first-person viewpoint, or simply express the subject's
beliefs about those mental events, events which may be entirely notional.[p.35]

</p><p>I don't see how Rosenthal has met the burden of establishing that these
putatively conscious events do in any way "constitute the subject's first-person
viewpoint"--indeed, in the passage I quoted earlier, he apparently stipulates
that in "Orwellian" cases, these events don't at all constitute the first-person
viewpoint--so I don't see that he has motivated his claim that these are
conscious events.

</p><p><b>Ned Block</b>'s essay is his fourth in a series (1992, 1993, 1995)
criticizing my theory of consciousness, and they arrive again and again
at the same verdict: he can't see anything radical about it. It's either
trivial or obviously false on any interpretation he can muster. He has
so far overlooked the reading I intended. We all have fixed points--assumptions
so obvious to us that we don't even consider them up for debate--and I
have long thought that Block's inability to <i>encounter</i> my theory
must be because he just couldn't bring himself to take seriously the idea
that I was challenging some of his fixed points. Now he has confirmed this
diagnosis, not just avowing that he has not taken it seriously but flatly
urging no one else to take it seriously as well!

</p><p>He says "I hope it is just obvious to virtually everyone that the fact
that things look, sound and smell more or less the way they do to us is
a basic biological feature of people, not a cultural construction that
children have to learn as they grow up." I must dash his hopes; it is neither
obvious, nor so much as true. He goes on to offer quite a list of ideas
"we should not take seriously." It is not just, as I had suspected, that
he was simply incapable of taking my hypotheses seriously. "My point,"
he says, "is that we should not take this question seriously. It is a poor
question that will just mislead us." No wonder he has been so unmoved by
my account! He has discarded it on general principles, without a hearing.
That is a serious failure of communication, but we can now repair it.

</p><p>Block agrees with me that consciousness is a "mongrel notion," and follows
my strategy of titration--breaking down the ungodly mess into its components--but
he underestimates the importance of the difference that language (and reportability)
makes. I took a shot at it in 1969 with my distinction between the awareness1
that language-using creatures have to the contents that "enter" their "speech
centers" and the awareness2 that marks appropriately discriminative uptake
and is "enjoyed" equally by anteaters, ants, and electric-eye door-openers.
As I have just acknowledged in my discussion of Rosenthal, that postulated
speech center was all too Cartesian, and the role that language plays in
consciousness is much more interesting and indirect than I saw in 1969,
so I have had to make major adjustments to that doctrine. But the continuing
importance of seeing a major distinction between the consciousness of language-users
and the so-called consciousness of all other entities is made particularly
clear by Block's work, which, by ignoring it, creates a powerful theoretical
illusion. Block puts <i>his</i> major division between "access" and "phenomenal"
consciousness, and, without further ado, declares that the "access" of
awareness2 is all the access that matters. Block deliberately frames access
consciousness so that language and hence reportability does <i>not</i>
play a role. "My intent in framing the notion is to make it applicable
to lower animals in virtue of their ability to use perceptual contents
in guiding their actions." <a href="http://cogprints.org/280/1/getreal.htm#26.">Endnote 26</a>

</p><p>As we shall see, this enhances the illusion that there is an "obvious"
sense of consciousness in which lower animals and infants are conscious,
and to make matters worse, Block actually enjoins people not to pursue
the questions that would expose this illusion. My own efforts to convince
Block of this in the past have all been frustrated, but he and I have kept
plugging away, and now I have hopes of straightening it all out. At least
he should now be able to see, for the first time, what my position is and
always has been. Again and again in this paper he asks what he takes to
be crushing questions, questions to which he thinks I can have no answer.
He will "surely" be surprised by my answers--and even more, I expect, when
I point out that these have always been my answers to them.

</p><p>Block's attitude in the current essay towards his own major division
(between "access" and "phenomenal" consciousness) is curiously ambivalent:
he wields it, acknowledges that I have rejected it, but excuses himself
from mounting the defense I say it needs. "We needn't worry," he tells
us, "about whether access-consciousness is really distinct from phenomenal
consciousness, since the question at hand is whether either of them could
be a cultural construction. I am dealing with these questions separately,
but I am giving the same answer to both, so if I am wrong about their distinctness
it won't matter to my argument." [p.3-4] But it does matter, since it is
the very move of supposing that he can make this cleavage between access
consciousness and phenomenal consciousness that conceals from him the way
in which consciousness could be a cultural construction. By looking at
two mis-isolated components of the phenomenon, Block has convinced himself
that since neither "separately" could be a cultural construction, consciousness
cannot be a cultural construction. But these supposed sorts of consciousness
don't make sense "separately"--they only seem to do so.

</p><p>To put it bluntly--for a few more details, see "The Path Not Taken,"
(1995b) my commentary on Block's most recent sally in <i>BBS</i>--Block
can't distinguish phenomenal consciousness from phenomenal <i>un</i>consciousness
without introducing some notion of access, a point he almost sees: "There
is a 'me'-ness to phenomenal consciousness." Like <b>Dretske</b>, he needs
there to be <i>some</i> sort of uptake to ensure that the "phenomenal"
is <i>to</i> or <i>for</i> some subject--or could phenomenal itches and
aromas just hang around <i>being conscious</i> without being conscious
to anyone? <b>Rosenthal</b> enunciates as if it were a constitutive principle
the intuitive demand that raises these problems for Dretske and Block:
"Still if one is in no way at all transitively conscious of a particular
mental state, then that state is not a conscious state." [p.12] This "transitive"
consciousness must be a variety of "access" consciousness, for it relates
"one" to what "one is conscious of". But once we let access come back in,
we will have to ask what sort of access we are talking about (for "phenomenal"
consciousness, mind you). Is the access to color boundary information enjoyed
by the part of your brain that controls eye-movements sufficient? If it
is, then the anesthetized subject (a monkey, most likely) whose eyes move
in response to these "perceived" colors is enjoying phenomenal consciousness.
And so forth. (In this area I think <b>Ivan Fox</b>'s essay has valuable
further lessons to offer.)

</p><p>Block doesn't tell us anything about which features of access would
suffice for phenomenal consciousness, but in any case, however Block would
resolve this issue, I resolve it, as he correctly notes, via the concept
of cerebral celebrity. This idea "seems more a theory of access-consciousness
than any of the other elements of the mongrel" but it is also, I claim,
a theory of phenomenal consciousness (after all, I deny the distinction).
Can this really be so? Could the sort of access requisite for <i>phenomenal</i>
consciousness really be "constructed" out of cerebral celebrity, and could
this feature in turn be a cultural construction? Block is forthright in
his incredulity. "I hope Dennett tells us how, according to him, cerebral
celebrity could be a cultural construction." But I already have, at great
length, over more than a decade. He just didn't notice.

</p><p>He helpfully italicizes his main error for us: "<i>But surely it is
nothing other than a biological fact about people--not a cultural construction--that
some brain representations persevere enough to affect memory, control behavior,
etc</i>." [p.5] Surely? No. Here Block completely overlooks all my patient
efforts to explain precisely why cerebral celebrity is <i>not</i> a biologically
guaranteed phenomenon. This is the point of all my discussion (going back
to <i>Elbow Room</i>) of the evolution of consciousness: to open up as
a serious biological possibility the idea that our brains are <i>not</i>
organized at birth, thanks to our animal heritage, in ways that automatically
guarantee the sorts of mutual influence of parts that is the hallmark of
"our access" to conscious contents. My little thought experiment about
talking to oneself (first in <i>Elbow Room</i>, pp.38-43, and, elaborated,
in <i>CE,</i> pp193ff) is central. It suggests a way--a dead simple way,
just to get our imaginations moving in the right direction--in which a
culturally "injected" factor, the use of language, could dramatically alter
the functionally available informational pathways in a brain. Now does
Block think that my story is inconceivable? Does he think it is inconceivable
that human infants, prior to rudimentary mastery of a language, and the
concomitant habits of self-stimulation, have brain organizations that do
not yet support "access" consciousness beyond the sorts "lower" animals
enjoy? Probably not. But tempting though it undoubtedly is, he may not
now fall back on his undefended distinction between access and phenomenal
consciousness. He is in no position to say: "Surely" these lower animals,
even if they do lack human-style access consciousness, have <i>phenomenal</i>
consciousness?! (cf Lockwood, 1993, Nagel, 1991, Dennett, 1995c)

</p><p>In an elegant paper, "Cued and detached representations in animal cognition,"
Peter Gärdenfors (forthcoming) points out "why a snake can't think
of a mouse."

</p><p>It seems that a snake does not have a central representation of a mouse
but relies solely on transduced information. The snake exploits three different
sensory systems in relation to prey, like a mouse. To strike the mouse,
the snake uses its <i>visual</i> system (or thermal sensors). When struck,
the mouse normally does not die immediately, but runs away for some distance.
To locate the mouse, once the prey has been struck, the snake uses its
sense of <i>smell</i>. The search behavior is exclusively wired to this
modality. Even if the mouse happens to die right in front of the eyes of
the snake, it will still follow the smell trace of the mouse in order to
find it. This unimodality is

</p><p>particularly evident in snakes like boas and pythons, where the prey
often is held fast in the coils of the snake's body, when it .e.g. hangs
from a branch. Despite the fact that the snake must have ample proprioceptory
information about the location of the prey it holds, it searches stochastically
for it, all around, only with the help of the olfactory sense organs. (Sjölander,
1993, p. 3)

</p><p>Finally, after the mouse has been located, the snake must find its head
in order to swallow it. This could obviously be done with the aid of smell
or sight, but in snakes this process uses only <i>tactile</i> information.
Thus the snake uses three separate modalities to catch and eat a mouse.

</p><p>Can we talk about what the snake, itself, "has access" to, or just about
what its various parts have access to? Is any of that obviously sufficient
for "phenomenal" (or any other kind of) consciousness? What--if anything--is
it like to be a (whole) snake? Postponing consideration of that question,
does such an example render plausible--at least worth exploring--my hypothesis?
My radical proposal is that the sorts of internal integrating systems the
snake so dramatically lacks but we have are in fact crucial for consciousness,
and they are not ours at birth, but something we gradually acquire, thanks
in no small measure to what Block calls "cultural injection." I hope that,
unlike Block, you think these are ideas that just might be worth taking
seriously. Block says: "True, consciousness modulates cerebral celebrity,
but it does not create it." It's almost the other way around: cerebral
celebrity <i>is</i> consciousness, and it is, in part, a cultural creation.
That, at any rate, is the phantom Dennettian claim that Block makes such
a labor of searching for.

</p><p>He's utterly right about the banality of the view that it takes culture
to <i>think of</i> oneself as a federal self; the interesting view is that
it takes culture to <i>become</i> a federal self. But he doesn't consider
this view.

</p><p>Whenever Block says "Surely," look for what we might call a mental block.
Here is another: "Surely, in any culture that allows the material and psychological
necessities of life, people genetically like us will have experiences much
like ours; there will be something it is like for them to see and hear
and smell things that is much like what it is like for us to do these things."
[p11]. Block says "in any culture"--and I have never claimed that consciousness
is a product of a very <i>specific</i> culture, since all sorts of human
cultures for tens if not hundreds of thousands of years have had the perquisites.
So Block ignores here the appropriate case, given my claims. What about
the (fortunately, imaginary) case of Robinson Crusoe human beings, each
raised in total isolation, in an entirely depopulated, a-social, a-cultural
world, with no mother to cuddle and feed them, no language to learn, no
human interactions at all? Is it obvious that "there will be something
it is like for them to see and hear and smell things that is much like
what it is like for us to do these things"? I don't think so. But "surely,"
you retort, however appallingly different it would be, it would be like
<i>something!</i> Well, here is where "what it is like" runs into trouble.
Is it obvious that it is "like something" to be an 8-month fetus in the
womb? Is it obvious that it is "like something" to be a python? The less
the functional similarities between normal adult, socialized consciousness
and the test case under consideration, the less obvious it is that we are
entitled to speak of "what it is like". Block's confidence about phenomenal
consciousness masks this growing tension by supposing, optimistically,
that <i>of course</i> there is something we can hold constant, in spite
of all these differences in "access" consciousness: phenomenal consciousness.
With this I flat disagree, and that is the primary source of our miscommunication
up to now. <a href="http://cogprints.org/280/1/getreal.htm#27.">Endnote 27</a>

</p><p>When we turn to Block's discussion of my comparison between consciousness
and money, I must first correct a misrepresentation of my view. I don't
say--let alone "repeatedly"--that you can't have consciousness unless you
have the concept <i>of consciousness</i>, but that the phenomenon of consciousness
depends on its subjects having a certain family of concepts (none of them
necessarily any concept of consciousness). In <i>CE</i>, I speak of consciousness
depending on "its associated concepts" (p.24). Block finds the one passage
in my homage to Jaynes in which I deliberately overstated this point (while
drawing attention to its "paradoxical" flavor). Let me try to undo the
damage of that bit of bravado. Acquiring a concept is, on almost any view
of concepts I have encountered, partly a matter of acquiring a new competence;
before you had the concept of <i>x</i>, you couldn't really <i>y</i>, but
now thanks to your mastery of the concept of <i>x</i> (and its family members
and neighbors--don't try to pin some sort of atomism on me here), you can
<i>y</i>, or more easily <i>y</i>, or more spontaneously <i>y</i>. Now
if consciousness is "good for something"--if having it gives one competences
one would lack without it--then there should be nothing surprising or metaphysically
suspect about the claim that the way you <i>make</i> something conscious
is by giving it (however this is done) some concepts that it doesn't already
have. And so it is somewhat plausible--at least worthy of consideration,
I would have thought--that <i>acquiring concepts</i> is partly a matter
of, or contributes to, building new accessibility relations between disparate
elements of a cognitive system. Concepts, you might say, are software links,
not hardware links. Well then, here's an idea: maybe consciousness just
<i>is</i> something that you gain by acquiring a certain sort of conceptual
apparatus that you aren't born with! If you say, but "surely" that couldn't
be true, since you have to <i>be</i> conscious to have concepts in the
first place, I reply: <i>that</i> is a Big Mistake that Jaynes helped overthrow.

</p><p>"It is hard to take seriously the idea that the human capacity to see
<i>and access</i> [emphasis added] rich displays of colors and shapes is
a cultural construction that requires its own concept." It is too hard
for Block to take seriously, that's for sure. But if he were right, why
don't the experimenters run the same color experiments on non-human mammals?
Hint: because non-human mammals don't "have access" to all the richness
of the colors and shapes their nervous systems nevertheless discriminate
in one way or another (<i>cf</i>. footnote 10 above on Dretske on color
vision in animals). Now perhaps you want to insist that the animals <i>do</i>
"have access" to all this richness, but just can't harness it the way we
can, to answer questions, etc., etc. That, however, is a surmise that is
fast losing ground, and rightly so. The idea that we can isolate a notion
of "access"--"you know, <i>conscious</i> access"--that is independent of
all the myriad things that access thereby enables is just an artifact of
imaginative inertia. It has no independent warrant whatever.

</p><p><i>7<a name="Qualia Refuse"></a>Qualia Refuse to go Quietly</i>

</p><p>What is color? <b>Joseph Tolliver</b> clearly describes the logical
space and the motivations behind the various theories of color that have
recently been proposed. By my lights, however, he has been insufficiently
critical of the shared assumptions of the literature he considers; what
should be seen as differences of emphasis have been pumped up into differences
of doctrine, rendered spuriously at odds by being forced into the procrustean
bed of essentialism, leading, as we have seen, to hysterical realism. In
fact, thanks to Tolliver, hysterical realism can be seen in a particularly
clear light. Consider his lovely example, alexandrite, the philosopher's
stone indeed. In sunlight it looks blue-green and in incandescent light
or candlelight, it looks red.<a href="http://cogprints.org/280/1/getreal.htm#28.">Endnote 28</a> What color is
it <i>really</i>? What makes anybody think this question must have an answer?
Essentialism. They think color has a real essence, and hence they cannot
tolerate a view that leaves the answer to such questions indeterminate.
Thus Edward Averill, raising his problems of counterfactual colors, poses
a litmus test for theories of color parallel to my stumper about magnets.
What would we say: that gold had changed its color or that the true color
of gold had been obscured? As Tolliver notes, when my evolutionary theory
faces this situation, it fails to resolve it. I don't view that as a criticism,
however, for I don't think that the question of what color gold <i>really</i>
is (in "all possible worlds") deserves attention.

</p><p>He sees that my evolutionary account gives you a "principled means"
of identifying the normal conditions, relative to the functions, and hence
the standards, by which we identify the class of observers. But it must
be essentialism ("color is a transworld property") that leads him to think
that these evolutionary considerations don't suffice, since they don't
provide similarly "principled" ways of fixing the standard viewing conditions
of colored things that played no role in our evolution, such as "lasers,
dichromic filters, gem stones, stars, and Benham disks." [p.22] So what?
All such colors should be considered mere byproducts of the perceptual
machinery designed to respond to the colors that have had evolutionary
significance for us or our ancestors. If the sky's being blue (to us) is
just a byproduct of the evolutionary design processes that adjusted human
color vision, then no functional account (which would assume that the sky
"ought" to look some particular color under some canonical circumstances)
is needed. If, however, some features of our responsivity to color (e.g.,
the pleasure we take in seeing blue) itself derives, indirectly, from some
later evolutionary response to this byproduct, then the sky's being blue
is "right"--but now for a reason that is purely anthropocentric, and none
the worse for that!

</p><p>Tolliver also makes the minor error of elevating my evolutionary explanation
of the grounding of color into some sort of constitutive claim on my part.
Evolution answers the question for us, since evolution is the source of
our functionality, but if the Creationists' story were true, then God the
Artificer would have to hold the key. That's fine with me, as a fantasy.
For I take it that we can readily imagine a race of robots endowed by their
creators with a sort of "color" vision (scare-quotes to mollify the scaredy-cats),
in which an entirely different set of patterns ruled, and ruled for equally
"principled" reasons. In that world, thanks to the design decisions of
the robots' creators, undesigned things (gem stones, stars, the sky) could
fit into color-equivalence classes different from ours. On either this
story or our non-fantastic evolutionary story, we anchor the standard conditions
to the class of normal observers by functional considerations.

</p><p>Tolliver's own functionalism is clearly superior to the alternatives
he considers, but I think he misses a few crucial points.

</p><p>Functional architecture is the formal structure that makes possible
the construction of complex representations within the symbolic system.
But the functional architecture is not another representation over and
above the representations defined by means of it. [p.27]

</p><p>True, but the functional architecture <i>does</i> contribute content--just
not by "being a representation." There are many other ways of contributing
content. Since this is an oft-ignored possibility, I wish I had hammered
harder on this theme when I first raised it, in my example of the "thing
about redheads" in "Beyond Belief" (1982, pp. 33-4; as reprinted in <i>The
Intentional Stance</i>, pp148-9.) The idea that content must all be packaged
in symbols or syntactic properties of representations is a very bad idea.
Tolliver shows how a color coding system can be implemented by ordered
triples, since every perceivable color can be uniquely placed in a three-space,
the color solid.<a href="http://cogprints.org/280/1/getreal.htm#29.">Endnote 29</a> "Surely," one is inclined
to argue, a system of color coding <i>all by itself</i> doesn't amount
to subjective color experience; there is nothing exciting or pleasurable,
for instance, about ordered triples! Adding a fourth variable to <i>represent</i>
the appropriate "affect" would not be a step in the right direction, and
"translating" the ordered triples back into "subjective colors" (or qualia)
would be a step in the <i>wrong</i> direction--a step back into the Cartesian
Theater. We take a step in the direction of genuine explanation by postulating
that these ordered triples are ensconced in a functional architecture in
such a way that they have the right sorts of high-powered functions--the
sort of thing Hardin and (earlier) Meehl note. That, the excitement potential
of colors, and their capacity to soothe and delight us, <i>is</i> part
of the content of color properties, and it is--must be--embodied in the
functional architecture of the color system. The person who cannot use
color as an alarm, as a reminder, as an ease in tracking or aide-memoire,
does not have <i>our</i> color system.

</p><p>My view of colors is an instance of what <b>Stephen White </b>calls
the holistic strategy towards the problem of saying what experienced colors
<i>are</i>, but Ned Block has raised his "Inverted Earth" fantasy against
any such view. I did not discuss Block's thought experiment in <i>CE</i>,
thinking its intricacies would not repay the time and effort it would take
to present and criticize them, especially since I thought I had provided
all the tools necessary to scuttle his case for anyone who sought them.
That was wrong. White's analysis of the difficulties facing Block's thought
experiment as published, and its subsequent post-publication variations,
goes far beyond anything I had laid the ground for. And since I have failed
to convince large and important segments of the philosophical audience,
I have been making at least a tactical error which White's work repairs.

</p><p>White treats patiently what I rush by with a few gestures. For instance,
his expansion of Block's 4-stage example to 5 stages permits him to spell
out--in enough imaginative detail to persuade--the sorts of thoughts "from
the inside" that would go on in you were you to be in Block's posited circumstances.
This was what I was getting at in <i>CE</i> at pp.393ff, especially the
example of the shade of blue that reminds you of the car in which you once
crashed. But White works it out so carefully, so crisply, that the point
cannot be lost. See especially his nice observation on the inevitability
of overcompensation, should your old hard-to-suppress inclination spontaneously
disappear faster than you expected. Another excellent point: the subpersonal
level could change in a gradual way while the personal level might stick
for awhile, until it flipped in a "gestalt switch."

</p><p>White then takes on notional worlds, an idea that I left rather vague
and impressionistic in "Beyond Belief," and sharpens it up with a variety
of his own insights and innovations to meet a host of objections. For the
reasons discussed in the section on cow-sharks, I have no stomach for discussions
of amnesiacs in blinding snowstorms who think they are being attacked by
a bear (<i>and</i> are under the impression that other snow-covered amnesiacs
are currently in the same pickle!), but for those who think such counterexamples
are telling, White has a detailed response, thus forcing the anti-relationalists
to take these ideas seriously. As he concludes from his examination, "Thus
if we think seriously about the full range of discriminatory skills that
a relational account can allow, its inadequacy as an account of our experience
is far less obvious." [p.38] Hear, hear.

</p><p>White's analysis also sharpens some points in Block's thought experiment
that then invite a short-cut objection that can be used to forestall whole
families of similar enterprises. In one of Block's variations, you have
an identical twin, who is sent off to Inverted Earth with contact lenses
chronically installed. As White notes: "Here we have two subjects whose
experiences have all the same qualitative properties, and hence the same
qualitative content, but different intentional contents." [p.5]. Block's
argument requires this assumption, but where does it come from? Must qualia
"supervene on" physical constitution? Thomas Nagel once claimed otherwise,
in conversation with me; he insisted that there was no way to tell of two
identical twins whether they had identical qualia. Whether or not qualia
do supervene on physical constitution, something else definitely does,
and that is what we might call functional micro-implementation--e.g., Tolliver's
ordered triples of <i>something small</i> in the brain. Thus in "Instead
of Qualia" (1994b), I describe color-discriminating robots that use numbers
in registers to code for the different "subjective" colors they discriminate.
The particular number systems they use (functionally parallel to the "file
keeping" system White describes) are physical micro-details that anchor
functions, but the numbers (which are arbitrary) could all be inverted
without any detectable functional change. These, presumably, are not qualia
that many qualophiles could love; they are in fact what I propose instead
of qualia. And I claim that they can do, without mystery, all the work
qualia were traditionally supposed to do--including telling qualia-inversion
fantasies!

</p><p>We can retell Block's thought experiment with two identical robots,
one of whom is sent off to Inverted Earth with contact lenses chronically
installed. Then we will have two robots whose "experiences" have all the
same details of functional micro-implementation, but different intentional
contents. Since everything Block says of you and your twin would also be
true of the robot and its twin on Inverted Earth, for exactly the same
reasons, and since qualia are not enjoyed by the robots (<i>ex hypothesi</i>),
Block's argument cannot be used to show why a functionalist needs to posit
qualia. Functional micro-implementation schemes will do just as well.

</p><p><b>Jeff McConnell</b> takes equal pains in his examination of another
fantasy, Frank Jackson's case of Mary the color scientist who is, in Diana
Raffman's fine phrase, chromatically challenged. I gave Mary short shrift
in <i>CE</i>, and McConnell gives her long shrift in the attempt to demonstrate
that Jackson's Knowledge Argument "remains alive and well" in the wake
of my criticisms. I think he has drastically underestimated their subversiveness.
They challenge not just the details but the whole strategy of attempting
to prove anything by Jackson's methods. I am claiming that it counts for
nothing--nothing at all--that Jackson's (or McConnell's or anybody's) intuitions
balk at my brusque alternative claim about Mary's powers. Their fixed points
are not my fixed points, but precisely the target of my attack. The most
that can be said for an intuition pump such as Jackson's, then, is that
it dramatizes these tacit presumptions, without giving them any added support.
Now of course I might be wrong, but one cannot defeat my counterargument
by blandly describing as an "insight" something I have been at considerable
pains to deny.

</p><p>In any case, McConnell gradually concedes some ground, if only for the
sake of argument, adding proviso after proviso to the original story. By
the time he is through, Jackson's deceptively crisp scenario has given
way to the utterly imponderable hypothesis that "it does not seem inconsistent
to suppose" that there could be a neuro-omniscient but imaginationally
challenged person who, in virtue of the latter and in spite of the former,
lacked the ability to construct a special sort of knowledge to be called
"imaginative knowledge" (defined in terms of the suspect category of phenomenal
properties). McConnell may think that the Knowledge Argument is still "alive
and well" after this exercise, but it sure looks like a shadow of its former
self to me, barely able to hold our attention, let alone vivify our convictions.

</p><p>At one juncture McConnell points to the gap in his own case: "My counterargument
shows that unless there is a defect in the <i>mechanics</i> of the Knowledge
Argument or a deep flaw in our common sense about what Mary knows, then
the standard positions about the nature of the mind are untenable." But
all along I have been claiming that there is just such a deep flaw in our
common sense.<a href="http://cogprints.org/280/1/getreal.htm#30.">Endnote 30</a> Our common sense is strongly
if covertly committed to the Cartesian Theater, and since many philosophers
have wondered who on earth I can be arguing against (since <i>they</i>
certainly weren't committed to there being a Cartesian Theater!), it will
be instructive to show how McConnell's own commitment to the Cartesian
Theater arises, especially since it is nicely concealed in his quite standard
exploitation of familiar philosophical assumptions. He builds his case
by extending the received wisdom about external reference in ordinary language
to internal reference:

</p><p>The success of demonstrative reference depends upon the demonstratum's
being picked out for demonstrator <i>and audience</i> by a mode or manner
of <i>presentation</i>--by something that individuates the cognitive significance
of referring expressions. [emphasis added] [p24]

</p><p>These assumptions are widely shared. It has seemed harmless to many
philosophers of mind to couch their discussions of reference in perception,
knowledge by acquaintance, inner ostension, and the like in the terms so
well analyzed by philosophers of language dealing with reference, ostension,
and similar phenomena in ordinary language. But as this passage nicely
illustrates, these are poisoned fruits that quietly force the hand of the
theorist: we have to have an inner <i>audience</i>, to whom things are
<i>presented</i>, if we are to take these familiar extensions of linguistic
categories literally (and if not literally, exactly what is left to be
asserted?). Thus philosophers have debates about "modes of presentation"
versus "definite descriptions in the language of thought" and the like,
but these only make sense if we are presupposing an inner agent, capable
of appreciating or perceiving presentations, or understanding the terms
of the definite descriptions, but still in need of being informed about
the matter in question, which is still somehow external to the agent. In
other words, these discussions all presuppose a Cartesian Theater occupied
by a Central Meaner who either has or has not yet been apprised of some
fact that must somehow be borne to him on the vehicle of some show that
must be presented, or some inner speech act that must be uttered, heard,
and understood. But this is forlorn. As I argued at length in <i>CE</i>,
this too-powerful inner agent has to be broken down, and all its work has
to be distributed in both space and time in the brain. When that is done,
the properties by which "agents" are "acquainted with" this and that have
to be broken down as well. That is the point, once again, of my answer
to the question of how I know these things: because a knower and reporter
of such things is what is me. (<i>CE</i>, p. 410) But see how McConnell
puts it:

</p><p>We know our qualitative mental states by acquaintance, picking them
out by direct reference as states "like <i>this</i>," so to speak, producing
states of recognition or imagination for display [to whom, pray tell?]
or ostending to ourselves [to our selves?] occurrent states. [p.25]

</p><p>This isn't common sense; this is disaster, for as he himself shows,
it leads quite inexorably to "irreducibly mental properties." Loar, on
McConnell's reading, is thus headed in the right direction in trying to
forestall this development. McConnell's objection to Loar--the imagined
Marcy--is thus question-begging: "Imagine someone, for example, who can,
without physical evidence, report and categorize many of her own brain
states, <i>even states that lack qualitative character</i> [emphasis added]."
[p.28] But what is "qualitative character" that might thus be absent? Who
says that there are any states that even <i>have</i> "qualitative character"?
It seems obvious to McConnell that there are "phenomenal properties," and
so he never truly confronts the denial I am issuing. Perhaps the most telling
instance--telling, because it strikes him as so tangential that he buries
it in footnote 19--is the following:

</p><p>The critic of the Knowledge Argument, however, must take the position
that her neuroscientific expertise would not just enable her to do this
but would <i>constitute</i> the grasping of phenomenal red, and this is
implausible. For it seems easy to imagine a person in Mary's shoes, someone
perhaps unlike Mary biologically, who doesn't have the powers of hallucination
Flanagan supposes but about whom we would say the things Jackson says of
Mary.

</p><p>I have at least tried to cast doubt on any such appeals to what "seems
easy to imagine" in these cases, claiming that after one undergoes a certain
amount of factual enrichment about the nature of color perception and related
topics, these things no longer seem so easy to imagine after all. That
they seem so to McConnell is thus a biographical fact of no immediate use
in an argument--at least not in an argument against me.

</p><p><b>Eric Lormand</b> brings out vividly how the Friends of the Cartesian
Theater can cling to their fantasies. He shows how many different escape
hatches there are for Theater-lovers, and points out that I can't block
them all at once. No doubt. For instance, you can always "postulate a distinctive,
nonprimitive but also nonrational means of access" [p.13], or some other
variety of "access mechanism" if you want to, but why? Whose access to
what? My point was to remove the motivation, but if you still <i>want</i>
to posit qualia, I doubt that I can show that you will inevitably contradict
yourself. I did not claim to prove <i>a priori</i> that there could not
be a Cartesian Theater; I claimed to prove, empirically, that there was
no Cartesian Theater, and that <i>since</i> there wasn't one, theories
that presuppose otherwise must be wrong. <a href="http://cogprints.org/280/1/getreal.htm#31.">Endnote 31</a>There
is an empirical point and then there is an <i>a priori</i> point, and the
two have not yet been clearly enough distinguished--by me or my readers.

</p><p>Consider the Brobdignagians, the giant people of <i>Gulliver's Travels</i>,
and suppose we set out to do some anthropology there, and decided that
the best way to do this was to make a giant humanoid puppet of sorts, controlled
by Sam, a regular-sized human being in the control room in the giant head.
(I guess that is at least as "logically possible" as the scenarios in other
thought experiments that are taken seriously.) Sam succeeds in passing
for Brobdignagian in his giant person suit, but then one day he encounters
Brobdignagian Dennett sounding off on the unreality of the Cartesian Theater
with its Central Meaner. Risky moment! Sam pushes the laugh button, and
directs the giant speech center to compose the appropriate response (in
translation): "Ha Ha! Who could ever take seriously the idea that there
was a control room in the head, the destination of all the input, and the
source of all the output! Such a fantasy!"--all the time hoping that his
ruse would not be uncovered. Yes, this thought experiment shows that a
Cartesian Theater is "possible," but we already know that there are no
such places in our own brains--that's the empirical point. We also know--this
is the <i>a priori</i> point--that sooner or later as we peel the layers
off any agent, we have to bottom out in an agent that <i>doesn't</i> have
a central puppeteer, and this agent will accomplish its aims by distributing
the work in the space and time of whatever counts as its brain. Putting
the two points together, we see that we have to live with these implications
sooner, not later. We have to live with them now.

</p><p>Lormand vividly supports my contention that qualia and the Cartesian
Theater stand or fall together. The reason he is a Friend of the Theater
is that he thinks he has to have qualia, and qualia without a Theater is
no show at all. But then we must ask: What does the claim that there really
are qualia get him? What does it explain? I'm not asking for a lot. I'd
be content if his only answer was: "It explains my unshakable belief that
I've got qualia!" But even this Lormand concedes to me. It would be quite
possible, he says, to believe you had qualia when you didn't. Philosophically
naive zimbos, for instance, would fervently believe they have qualia. As
I said in my discussion of Levine, I view zimbos as a <i>reductio</i>.
Others don't, but that's their problem, not mine.

</p><p>The hydra-headed qualia live on, in Lormand's various options, shifting
from one vision to another. That is enough to establish one of my main
points for me: you simply cannot talk about qualia with the presumption
that everyone knows what you're talking about. These different avenues
are too different. It is only equivocation that permits the various different
qualophiles to claim they agree about something, to wit: qualia.

</p><p><i>8.&nbsp;<a name="Luck"></a>Luck, Regret, and Kinds of Persons</i>

</p><p>Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger across a crowded room--or
you may not, and it may make all the difference, as the song suggests.
For the stranger might have tempted you into moral dilemmas that you were
not "ethically gifted" enough to resolve honorably, and then your life
might end in ignominy, disgrace, and bitter regret. Or the stranger might
have provoked you to embark in a direction that led you to acts of great
courage and self-sacrifice, bestowing on you a hero's role that otherwise
would have been inaccessible to you. In such a case, luck makes a huge
difference, we can reasonably suppose, and has nothing to do with the prospect
of negligence, or the capacity to estimate probabilities, important though
those considerations often are.

</p><p>I take myself to have been, so far, quite a good fellow; I have no terrible
sins on my conscience. But I am also quite sure that there are temptations
that, had they been placed before me, I would not have been able to resist.
Lucky me; I have been spared them, and hence can still hold my head up
high. It is not <i>just</i> luck, of course; policy has had something to
do with it. I don't go looking for trouble, but I also don't go looking
for opportunities to be a hero. Some people face life with a different
attitude: they play for high stakes--hero or villain, with little likelihood
of a bland outcome. And surely <b>Michael Slote</b> is right that some
people are more ethically gifted than others by accident of birth--and
other accidents. Perhaps in the best of all possible worlds, only the ethically
gifted would be inspired to play for high stakes lives, while we more cowardly
and self-indulgent folks just tried to keep our noses clean.

</p><p>I am very glad Slote didn't give up on me altogether. After <i>Elbow
Room</i>, in which I put some of his good work to good use, he proposed
we join forces on an article developing further our shared views about
luck, modality and free will, to which I readily agreed. He sent me some
notes and sketches, but for reasons unknown to me, I never picked up my
end. The engine was running, but somehow I couldn't let out the clutch.
His essay on this occasion reminds me of how fruitful I find his perspective,
and makes me regret all the more my strange inactivity in response to his
previous sally. On this occasion, the focus is on the curious role of luck
in rendering our acts blameworthy or praiseworthy. When it comes to assigning
blame and credit, Slote suggests, we are confronted by an irresoluble war
of competing intuitions. Blame should not be a matter of luck at all, proclaims
one intuition, but living by that standard would seem to force us to absolve
everyone always, which goes equally against the grain. One variety of compromise
would be what Slote calls <i>moral criticism without blame</i>. This would
extend to adults at their most responsible the attitude we tend to endorse
towards young children; since we want them to improve, we are firm in our
condemnation of their bad behavior, but we don't condemn <i>them</i>. We
hold them quasi-responsible, you might say, not thereby illuminating anything.

</p><p>Isn't it the case that any policy, any ethical theory, must accept luck
as part of the background? Given that luck is always going to play a large
role, what is the sane, defensible policy with regard to luck? Set up a
system that encourages individuals to take luck into consideration in a
reasonable way by not permitting them to cite bad luck when it leads them
astray. The culpability of the driver is settled as a matter of higher-order
holding accountable: we have given you sufficient moral education so that
from now on you are a person (in <b>Carol Rovane</b>'s sense), deemed accountable,
like it or not, not only for your acts but for your policies. If you are
reckless and get away with it, you are just lucky, but if you are reckless
and thereby bring about great harm, you will have no excuse. If you are
not reckless but bring about great harm, your blame will be diminished.
Slote expresses mild sympathy for such a policy (see fn 4), but thinks
it won't do. The problem, I gather, is that since there would still be
unsupportably counter-intuitive implications in any such policy (in Slote's
eyes), it could be maintained only by slipping in one way or another into
the systematic disingenuousness Bernard Williams (1985 p.101) calls "Government
House utilitarianism,"

</p><p>Peter Vallentyne has suggested to him that the situation is not so grim;
tying praise and blame to probabilities, not outcomes, has some intuitive
support in any case, so some of the jarring intuitions might be ignored.
Slote finds this attractive, but thinks that "it is a mistake to say nothing
more needs to be said." [p16] Let me try to fill that gap a little. Slote
lists two items of common-sense that obtrude:

</p><p>a) the difference of blameworthiness between cases where an accident
occurs and cases where none occurs and b) our intuitive sense that the
person whose negligence leads to an accident doesn't enjoy a low degree
of blameworthiness (simply because of the extreme unlikelihood of an accident).
[p.17]

</p><p>I suggest that our intuitions are playing tricks on us here--at least
to some extent. With regard to a), consider the case in which you learn
that Jones has enticed your child to play Russian roulette with a loaded
revolver. Fortunately, both survive unharmed, but your <i>moral condemnation</i>
of Jones will be scarcely diminished compared to the case in which your
child actually dies. Is he blameworthy? He most certainly is. We don't
get to put him in prison for murder, thanks to his undeserved luck, but
we might think it entirely appropriate to ensure that nobody ever forgot,
for the rest of his days, what an evil thing he did. In other words, I
think Jones is just as <i>blameworthy</i> in both cases, even though there
is vastly more harm to regret, and therefore more justifiable anger, in
the catastrophic case, and I think common sense is comfortable with this,
after all. Now go to the other extreme, and imagine the following variation
on the scenic drive. You are showing friends the mountain scenery, and
see a scenic lookout turnoff up ahead. "Let's just stop, so I can show
this magnificent view to you!" you say, but your friends demur. "Don't
bother, we can see it well enough while moving along." But you persist,
and as you turn off the highway into the lookout, sunlight glinting off
your windshield momentarily blinds the schoolbus driver, and calamity ensues.
In this case, you broke no laws, you weren't negligent in any way, you
were a good, safe driver. But for the rest of your life you will surely
be racked with regret, thinking "if only I hadn't persisted!" This regret
is not self-reproach; you know in your heart that you <i>did nothing wrong</i>.
But this regret about that awful free choice of yours will perhaps overwhelm
your thoughts--and the thoughts of all the parents of those dead schoolchildren--for
years. Now alter the circumstances ever so slightly: in order to enter
the scenic turnoff, you had to brake rather more suddenly than cars typically
do, and it was the distraction of the bus driver in response to your (arguably)
negligent braking that caused the accident. A tiny bit of negligence now,
and <i>at least as much regret</i>. How much self-reproach? How much moral
blameworthiness? Can we isolate in our imaginations the regret that any
bad-outcome act is likely to provoke, and distinguish it clearly and reliably
from the moral (self-)condemnation--if any--that is provoked in unison?
If not, then perhaps--this is just a hypothesis for further thought-experimental
exploration--Slote's conviction that a) and b) are worthy items of common-sense
can be undermined. But there is still more to be said, of course.

</p><p>Saving the best for last, I come to <b>Carol Rovane</b>'s wonderfully
constructive essay. She takes the main ideas in "Conditions of Personhood"
and fixes them. They needed fixing. It is great to see ideas I like a lot
protected from second-rate versions of them--my own. She wonders whether
I will reject her revisions and elaborations or embrace them. I embrace
them, with a few further amendments and virtually no reservations worth
mentioning. Thus she is right that (1) my six conditions of personhood
fall naturally into two groups of three; (2) I would be in much better
position if I retreated from Kant as she recommends, opening up ethical
disagreement among persons; (3) persons are <i>committed to</i> all-things-considered
judgments, even though we can't actually make them; (4) I can have my naturalism
and gradualism, and still have a rather sharp watershed dividing the persons
from the non-persons; (5) her alternative is a "more integrated, and explanatorily
complete, conception of the person, in which the ethical and metaphysical
dimensions of personhood are in perfect accord." [ms, p.18]

</p><p>Indeed, I just made use of points (4) and (5) in my commentary on Slote.
Although different human beings may not be equally "ethically gifted,"
those that have the capacity to treat others as persons, are precisely
those who are fit to be run through the mill of reason-giving. Those who
are disqualified for personhood by not being up to the exercise are excused,
but for those who <i>are</i> fit, there is indeed a choice, and if you
are in this special category, you can stand convicted of having made a
wrong (but informed, rational) choice. This watershed permits us to settle
the inevitable penumbral cases of near-persons, persons-to-be, persons
on the verge of incompetence, etc., in an ethically stable and satisfying
way. (It doesn't <i>settle</i> all the morally troubling cases, of course--that
would be too much to ask for--but it lays the ground for settling them
as best we can.) As she says, she argues "<i>from</i> the ethical criterion
of personhood <i>to</i> Dennett's list of conditions of metaphysical personhood,
thereby preserving his uncompromisingly normative approach." [ms,.p.18]

</p><p>What about her discussion of rationality, evaluation, and higher order
intentionality in animals? I have come to realize in recent years that
human rationality is <i>so</i> much more powerful than that of any animal,
that, as she says, my "list of six conditions does not capture a spectrum
of rational sophistication at all." [p.48] I have begun discussing alternative
spectra in recent years (in<i> Darwin's Dangerous Idea</i>, and "Learning
and Labeling" 1993c) and I intend to develop these ideas further, in a
little book to be called <i>Kinds of Minds</i>, which will soon be completed.
Therein I will offer a somewhat different account from the one sketched
by Rovane, but not different in any way that undercuts her points. I have
been stumbling along towards this for years. Ashley's dog was just the
first of many cases to consider. Reading, listening to, and even working
with ethologists over the years has taught me a lot about the differences,
as well as the similarities, between animal and human minds. Discussing
Gricean communication, she notes that "it is the absence of a guarantee
for the first sort of reliability that affords the possibility of sincerity
and insincerity." [p.45] Yes, as Gibsonians would say, there are <i>affordances</i>
here, affordances that simply do not exist for non-persons, such as vervet
monkeys and other animal quasi-communicators. (I now think, by the way,
that Sperber and Wilson's (1986) vision of communication is much more realistic
than Grice's, and would save some minor errors of over-idealization in
her account.)

</p><p>What, finally, of her punch line about multiple and group persons? I
have already granted MPD--with suitable caveats--as she notes. In my discussion
of <b>Lynne Rudder Baker</b> above, I opened the door to group persons,
not quite for the first time. There is my brief definition and discussion
of FPD, "Fractional Personality Disorder," <i>CE</i>, pp.422-423. Since
my theory of the self (or personhood) "predicts" FPD, I am now on the lookout
for instances of its acknowledgment in print. My favorite to date is the
comment by one of the actors in the Coen brothers' film, "Barton Fink,"
when asked what it was like to act in a film with two directors. The reply:
"Oh, there was only one director; he just had two bodies."

<p><a name="1."></a>1. I am grateful for constructive feedback from Nikola
Grahek and Diana Raffman, at the Center for Cognitive Studies at Tufts,
and Derek Browne and his colleagues and students at Canterbury University,
Christchurch, New Zealand, where drafts of this essay were prepared and
discussed.

</p><p>&nbsp;<a name="2."></a>2.The Fox Islands Thorofare is a beautiful but
treacherous passage between the Scylla of North Haven and the Charybis
of Vinal Haven, in Penobscot Bay.

</p><p>&nbsp;<a name="3."></a>3.Good Old Fashioned AI (Haugeland, 1985) and
Language of Thought (Fodor, 1975).

</p><p>&nbsp;<a name="4."></a>4. Dedictomorphs are zombies, he tells us [p59],
and I wonder how one can tell whether a particular implementation of Cog
is a dedictomorph. Not by behavior, since a dedictomorph "may conform to
the outward behavior of persons with <i>de re</i> states." But then why
should the Cog team worry about getting <i>de re</i> states into Cog?

</p><p>&nbsp;<a name="5."></a>5. By far the best model of a research program
in phenomenology that uses the fruits of careful introspection to discern
the features of engineering models is Douglas Hofstadter Fluid Analogy
Research Group. See Hofstadter, 1995 (and my review, forthcoming in <i>Complexity</i>)
Mitchell (1993), and French (forthcoming).

</p><p>&nbsp;<a name="6."></a>6. I was surprised that Fox didn't use the standard
term "user illusion" It fits his case rather well, since he claims that
the phenomenal world is a benign, designed illusion of sorts (a <i>philosophical</i>
illusion).

</p><p>&nbsp;<a name="7."></a>7. At just one point, I thought Fox's phenomenology
fell into error. He claims [p14] to be able to "remember melodies which
(for me) have an intervalic structure but no pitch." I cannot do this,
any more than I can remember or imagine a melody which reels off in no
particular tempo. Melody seems entirely unlike imagined speech in this
regard; imagined speech, for me and others I have queried, can have tempo
and prosodic contour without any pitch. I raised the melody issue with
Diana Raffman and Ray Jackendoff, both accomplished musicians; neither
of them can do what Fox says he can do, so either he has a rare talent,
or has given us a demonstration of how phenomenologists can be wrong about
even their carefully considered claims.

</p><p><a name="8."></a>8. In the same article Dretske also cites the amazing
case of eidetic imagery reported by Stromeyer and Psotka in <i>Nature</i>,
1970, in support of his theory of "thing-awareness". But Stromeyer and
Psotka's report turned out to be too good to be true. Their subject refused
to cooperate with those who wanted to replicate the original experiment,
and it is now generally presumed that the results were fraudulent, a practical
joke played on the experimenters, most likely. This is not a trivial matter;
Dretske needs something like this imaginary result to support his position,
just as my theory needs support of the sort provided by Grimes' experiments,
and more recently, those of Rensink, O'Regan and Clarke, to be described
shortly. (Dretske also cites, in fn. 13, the "well-known experimental demonstration"
by C. W. Perky. This series of experiments--conducted in 1910!--is in fact
seldom cited any more, and is perhaps best known for not being replicated
by others. For a neutral account, see Brown and Herrnstein, 1975, pp435-6.)

</p><p><a name="9."></a>9. The game of Hide the Thimble actually exploits something
very close to Dretske's concept of non-epistemic seeing. The rules are
clear: you must hide the thimble <i>in plain sight</i>. It must not be
concealed behind anything, for instance, or too high on a shelf to fall
within the visual fields of the searchers. Or one might say: the "hidden"
thimble must be <i>visible</i>. Is something that is visible <i>seen</i>
as soon as it <i>can</i> be seen by someone looking at it? That seems to
be what Dretske's concept of non-epistemic seeing insists upon.

</p><p>&nbsp;<a name="10."></a>10. Dretske misses the point of my claims about
the lack of clarity of animal consciousness--a fact that I would think
would have become obvious to him when he noted, as he does, the passages
in which I calmly grant sight--color vision--to birds and fish and honeybees.
It must be, mustn't it, that I don't think seeing is a matter settled by
experience (conscious experience--of the sort he finds obvious). He does
see the way out: "being aware of colors does not require consciousness"
[ms,p.6], but he can't see how this can be taken seriously. Why not? Because,
I think, he is still committed to ordinary language philosophy. But vision,
and color vision, can be, and routinely are, investigated in complete disregard
of the <i>ordinary</i> senses of "aware" and "see" and "conscious". There
is no doubt at all that honeybees have color vision; whether they are conscious
in any interesting sense is quite another matter.

</p><p><a name="11."></a>11. Blindsight in Nicholas Humphrey's monkey Helen
is a particularly challenging case for Dretske (Humphrey, 1974, 1984).
To put it with deliberate paradox, did Helen see--in Dretske's sense--in
spite of her blindness? Humphrey and I once showed his film of Helen to
a group of experts--psychologists and primatologists--at a meeting at Columbia
University, and asked them if they could detect anything unusual about
Helen, and if so what. For ten minutes they watched the film of Helen busily
darting about in her space, picking up raisins and pieces of chocolate
and eating them, avoiding obstacles, never making a false move or bumping
into anything. Nobody suggested that there was anything wrong with her
vision, but her entire primary visual cortex had been surgically removed.
She was cortically blind. Would Dretske say that this was a case of epistemic
seeing without non-epistemic seeing?

</p><p><a name="12."></a>12. In fn. 19, Dretske mistakenly dismisses this as
an avenue unworthy of my exploration--a measure of how much misunderstanding
there has been between us.

</p><p>&nbsp;<a name="13."></a>13. This was also brought home to me by Hill,
1995, and the ensuing discussion.

</p><p>&nbsp;<a name="14."></a>14. What about real cases of peripheral paralysis?
First, the only real cases have to be people who have lived an unparalyzed
life for years--all other imaginable cases are cow-sharks, only logically
possible and rudely dismissable. Second, the persistent integrity of the
internal structures on which their continuing mental lives putatively depends
is not a foregone conclusion. To the extent that the paralysis is truly
just peripheral (unaccompanied by the atrophy of the internal), then, of
course, such a sorry subject could go on living a mental life (as I imagined
myself doing in the vat, in "Where am I?"). But all good things come to
an end, and in the absence of normal amounts of "peripheral narrow behavior,"
mental life will surely soon fade away, leaving only historical traces
of the vigorous aboutness its activities once exhibited. How long would
it take? A gruesome empirical question, whose answer has no metaphysical
significance.

</p><p>&nbsp;<a name="15."></a>15. If all these examples concern opinions,
not beliefs, then why not just re-construe the theory of propositional
attitudes as the theory of opinions? Because there could be no such theory--for
the same reason there is not theory of <i>things said</i>: people say the
darndest things. People can be got to say all manner of crazy things for
all manner of weird reasons; the set of things they say, or would say under
various provocations, is not a tidy set of phenomena for which one might
reasonably aspire to provide a theory. The set of opinions is very much
like--is scarcely distinct from--this set of things said.

</p><p><a name="16."></a>16. Rorty has warned me that feminists will object
to my use of the word "hysterical", but I am confident that few if any
feminists would be so insensitive to irony as to overlook the recursion
that would occur were they to object to my usage. It's a fine word, the
only word we have for a real phenomenon, and it would be cretinous to denigrate
it because of its ignoble etymology.

</p><p><a name="17."></a>17. While he is at it, he might tell us how he would
show that there <i>is</i> a fact of the matter about just when--<i>i.e</i>.,
to the day or week--the British Empire learned of the signing of the treaty
ending the war of 1812. Is it determined by the dates and postmarks on
the various documents, or by their time of arrival at various critical
places, or by some combination of such factors? He had better not say that
the question is meaningless, and hence has no proper answer--that would
be raving superficialism about empires.

</p><p>&nbsp;<a name="18."></a>18.In spite of the gulf of disagreement, it
is good to see that Rey joins me in giving the back of his hand to zombies
and their ilk. The trouble I see with his way of doing it is that the qualophiles
and zombists can complain, with some justice, that he is just changing
the subject, redefining the problem out of existence.

</p><p>&nbsp;<a name="20."></a>20.In heavy water, the heavy isotope of hydrogen,
H2 or D, replaces the ordinary hydrogen atom. Heavy water is found in about
1 part per 5000 in ordinary water; it has slightly higher freezing and
boiling temperatures than ordinary water, seeds can't germinate in it,
and tadpoles can't live in it. XYZ must be more like H20 than deuterium
oxide is, and deuterium oxide is a kind of water.

</p><p>&nbsp;<a name="21."></a>21. In "Beyond Belief," my example was the scientifically
backward people who had a word for "gas" or perhaps "gaseous hydrocarbon"--surely
a fine natural kind, but on this minimalist principle it would have to
be translated "methane," since this is in fact the only gaseous hydrocarbon
they have encountered.

</p><p>&nbsp;<a name="22."></a>22. Besides, it seems to me that if you renounce
the neutrality of heterophenomenology, you make it systematically impossible
to close the putative explanatory gap, because you give up <i>ab initio</i>
on the goal of finding a rapprochement between the first and third person
point of view. What shape could a closing of "the explanatory gap" take?
It seems to me it would have to be an explanation that permitted one to
tell a third-person, scientific story about subjectivity. I don't see how
anything else would count as a closing of the gap. So far as I know, nobody
has defended another framework.

</p><p><a name="23."></a>23. "Outsmart, v. To embrace the conclusion of one's
opponent's <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> argument. "They thought they have
me, but I outsmarted them. I agreed that it <i>was</i> sometimes just to
hang an innocent man." <i>The Philosophical Lexicon</i>, (Dennett, 1978b)

</p><p>&nbsp;<a name="24."></a>24. Rosenthal says at one point [p.17] that
"it can happen that, even though one doesn't consciously see an object,
one later recalls just where it was and what it looked like." I wonder
what his evidence for this startling claim is. Wouldn't this be confounded
with high-quality blindsight beyond anything yet reported in the literature?
How would Rosenthal tell the two phenomena apart?

</p><p><a name="25."></a>25. This is the illusion typically engendered by functionalistic
"boxology" (<i>CE</i>, 270n, 358n). One defines a box in a flow chart in
terms of the functional role anything entering it plays, and then forgets
that if this is how "entrance" into that particular "box" is defined, it
makes no sense to excuse an occupant of any of the defining powers. The
boxes are not automatically salient tissues, organs, or separate media
in the systems described, such that entrance into them can be distinguished
independently of fulfilling the defining functional roles.

</p><p><a name="26."></a>26. <b>Robert Van Gulick</b> correctly notes the strong
tie between consciousness and reportability I have always endorsed. Since
inability to report is in fact our most heavily relied upon grounds for
presuming non-consciousness--in blindsight, for instance--when you loosen
the tie to reportability, as Van Gulick suggests, you face the problem
of motivation in a particularly severe form.

</p><p><a name="27."></a>27. I am partly to blame, since I have myself often
introduced Nagels' famous formula into the discussion, without being sufficiently
explicit in announcing my rejection of its presuppositions. It is, I think,
a chief source of this illusion of constancy of meaning in our questions
about consciousness.

</p><p>&nbsp;<a name="28."></a>28. Wanting to obtain a hunk of alexandrite
(to see for myself), I consulted a geologist friend, who provided the appropriate
literature, including color photographs of this marvelous mineral--but
no samples, sad to say. Alexandrite is rare, and consequently commands
a price commensurate with other gem stones.

</p><p><a name="29."></a>29. See also Dennett, 1993b, 1994b, where these ideas
are developed further.

</p><p>&nbsp;<a name="30."></a>30. I am unmoved, then, by his advice to Churchland
and me that we adopt a different strategy. I'm speaking for myself, and
will not venture an opinion about Churchland's argument or McConnell's
criticisms of it, since I don't rely on it.

</p><p>&nbsp;<a name="31."></a>31. At one point, Lorman says: "My retinal and
other very early visual representations are as rich or richer in difficult-to-express
information as the osprey experience, yet I can say <i>exactly</i> what
it's like to have them: <i>nothing!</i>' [p.22.] Why does he think this
is true? Presumably because he thinks that while "very early visual representations"
are unconscious, some "late visual representations" are conscious. But
this is a terrible model of consciousness. It is true that "later" cerebral
effects (not necessarily representations) are necessary for one to become
conscious of the contents of one's early visual representations, but when
those normal effects are there, no "later" visual representation has to
occur. So normally it <i>is</i> like something for us to have them.
