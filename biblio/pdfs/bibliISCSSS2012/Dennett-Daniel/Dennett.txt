Title:
A Phenomenal Confusion about Access and Consciousness

Abstract:
Many researchers on consciousness have adopted Ned Block’s purported distinction between “access” consciousness and “phenomenal” consciousness (Block, 1995, 2005, 2007), but in spite of its evident appeal, it is not a defensible distinction. Earlier critiques (Dennett, 1994, 1995, Cohen and Dennett, 2012) have not deterred those who favor the distinction, but perhaps one more exposition of the problems will break through.
