The differences Block attempts to capture with his putative distinction
between P-consciousness and A-consciousness are more directly and perspicuously
handled in terms of differences in richness of content and degree of influence.
Block's critiques, based on his misbegotten distinction, evaporate on closer
inspection.</p></dt>

Block amply demonstrates that there is ubiquitous confusion among researchers
about consciousness, and he is right to locate a major source of the confusion
in the spectrum of differences he attempts to tame with his purported distinction
between P-consciousness and A-consciousness. That distinction may start
out seeming quite intuitive. Indeed, Block relies heavily on appeals to
our intuitions to hold it in place until he can get it properly defined
and defended, but once that effort gets underway, he runs into a swarm
of difficulties from which there is apparently no escape. I for one found
it difficult to keep track of the tangle of objections and counterobjections,
exemptions, caveats and promissory notes, and will be interested to see
if other commentators can find their way into, and back out of, the maze
Block has created.</dt>
</dl>
&nbsp;There is an alternative, much more direct path which he ignores,
perhaps because it is deeply counterintuitive at first blush: the varieties
of consciousness he thinks he sees falling under P-consciousness and A-consciousness
can all be accommodated under the two rough <i>quantitative</i> headings
of <i>richness of content</i> and <i>degree of influence</i>. Some episodes
of mental life have impoverished contents, while others are so rich in
content--so full of information about the perceived world, for instance--that
one has the sense that no practical description or catalogue could do justice
to them. The latter--and they are the normal, everyday episodes of consciousness--Block
would declare to be instances of P-consciousness because they are, shall
we say, <i>phenomenologically impressive</i>. The former, such as actual
(as opposed to imaginary) cases of blindsight, have such vanishingly little
content that subjects standardly deny that they are conscious of any content
at all, though forced-choice guessing famously demonstrates that there
was some content at work there after all, capable of influencing some choices,
but unable to serve as the cue or prompt for rational action. Can such
simple differences of quantity, not quality, do justice to the variety
of phenomena? Don't we need something altogether different--<i>qualia</i>
(or their absence)--as well? I have said No, and have defended this claim
at length (Dennett, 1991), but it was apparently too drastic a stroke for
some readers to accept--or in the case of Block, to be recognized as a
serious alternative to be dealt with at all. But now Block has done my
theory a fine service: nothing could make my admittedly counterintuitive
starting point easier to swallow than Block's involuntary demonstration
of the pitfalls one must encounter if one turns one's back on it and tries
to take his purported distinction seriously.

<p>The main trouble with Block's attempt to motivate two independent dividing
lines (where I would put differences in degree) is that in the normal run
of things, his two kinds of consciousness run together, as he himself acknowledges
several times. He cannot provide clear examples of A-consciousness without
P-consciousness or P-consciousness without A-consciousness, and while he
claims that both are "conceptually possible," it is unclear what this comes
to. Moreover, if these two sorts of consciousness are conceptually independent,
as Block insists, then he is not entitled to several claims he makes about
P-consciousness. Consider, for instance, his discussion of the phenomenon
in which the solution to a difficult problem suddenly comes to you without
conscious thought. He surmises that the "high level reasoning processes"
by which you solve such a problem are not P-conscious (in addition to not
being A-conscious). How does he know this? How could he know this, or even
deem this more probable than not? He notes--but is apparently not embarrassed
by--a similar problem with his account of blindsight. "Note that the claim
that P-consciousness is missing in blindsight is just an assumption. I
decided to take the blindsight patient's word for his lack of P-consciousness
of stimuli in the blind field." (ms, p.27-8) But taking the subject's word
is using the best criterion for A-consciousness as one's sole evidence
of P-consciousness. Block himself demonstrates thereby that the very idea
of a sort of consciousness independent of access is incoherent.

</p><p>Although Block discusses my theory of consciousness at some length,
his discussion always leans on the presupposition that his putative distinction
is in place. My theory of consciousness is stranded, he concludes, between
being trivially false (if a theory of P-consciousness), non-trivially false
(if a theory of "just" A-consciousness) and banal if a theory of "a highly
sophisticated version of self-consciousness." (ms. p22) But since I not
only decline to draw any such distinction, but argue at length against
any such distinction, Block's critique is simply question-begging. I may
be wrong to deny the distinction, but this could not be shown by proclaiming
the distinction, ignoring the grounds I have given for denying it, and
then showing what a hash can then be made of ideas I have expressed in
other terms, with other presuppositions. If Block thinks his distinction
is too obvious to need further defense, he has missed the whole point of
my radical alternative. This is a fundamental weakness in the strategy
Block employs, and it vitiates his discoveries of "fallacies" in the thinking
of other theorists as well. Those of us who are not impressed by his candidate
distinction are free to run the implication in the other direction: since
our reasoning is not fallacious after all, his distinction must be bogus.

</p><p>&nbsp;What would a good test of the two different starting points be?
Look at their treatment of a particular phenomenon--e.g. blindsight--from
a neutral point of view. In my own discussion of blindsight (1991, p.332-43),
I argued that if a patient could be trained to treat blindsight stimuli
as self-cuing or prompting, this would amount to <i>restoring</i> the patient's
consciousness of events in the scotoma, the only remaining difference between
such experience and normal vision being the relative poverty of the content
of what could be gleaned from the scotoma. Relative poverty of content--not
"absence of qualia" or lack of P-consciousness--was a non-optional hallmark
of blindsight, I claimed. To drive the point home, I asked, counterfactually,
what we would conclude if we encountered someone who <i>claimed</i> to
suffer from blindsight of a strange high-content variety--correctly "guessing"
not just the words written on a page placed in the putative scotoma, for
instance, but their typeface and color, for instance. I claimed this would
stretch our credulity beyond the limit; we would not and should not take
somebody's word that they were "just guessing" in the absence of all consciousness
(all P-consciousness, in Block's terms) in such a case. Block, interestingly,
thinks otherwise. He does not refer to my discussion of blindsight, but
coins the term "superblindsight" to discuss much the same sort of imaginary
case, and supposes without argument that in such a case we <i>would</i>
credit the patient: "The superblindsighter himself contrasts what it is
like to know visually about an 'X' in his blind field and an 'X' in his
sighted field. There is something it is like to experience the latter,
but not the former." (p.12)

</p><p>Now here we have a direct difference of implication between the two
starting points--a useful point of contrast even if the cases are not likely
to come up for empirical confirmation! But the issue is not yet joined
if we imagine the case the way Block invites us to do, with the huge normal
difference in richness of content between the sighted field and the scotoma
or blind field. If our imaginary patient, like all actual blindsight patients
yet studied, can identify the typeface, size, colors and textures of the
sighted-field 'X' and its background, but can only identify that there
is an 'X' (as opposed to an 'O') in the blind field, this would be a large
difference in richness of content that would account, on my view, for the
patient's willingness to draw the sort of contrast Block imagines the superblindsighter
to draw: it is "like something" to detect the 'X' in the sighted field,
and it isn't like anything to detect the 'X' in the blind field.

</p><p>For Block to put his claim about blindsight in direct competition with
my alternative, he must control for richness of content, which I claim
is the only other important variable; he must stipulate--in whichever way
he chooses--that the richness in content is the same in both fields. The
patient can tell us no more about the 'X' in the sighted field than about
the 'X' in the blind field--either because the former is bizarrely impoverished,
or the latter is bizarrely rich. Take the latter case first: would you
"take the subject's word," as Block says, that <i>it wasn't like anything
at all</i> for him to come to know, swiftly and effortlessly, that there
was a bright orange Times Roman italic 'X' about two inches high, on a
blue-green background, with a pale gray smudge on the upper right arm,
almost touching the intersection? (That's a sample of the sort of richness
of content normally to be gleaned from the sighted field, after all.) I
for one would wonder what sort of lexical amnesia or madness had overcome
anybody who could gather that much information from a glance and yet deny
having any conscious visual experience. Alternatively, if all our imaginary
patient can tell us about the 'X' in the <i>sighted</i> field is just that
it was an 'X', not an 'O,' I think most people would be baffled about what
he could possibly mean by his insistence that nevertheless he had "P-consciousness"
of the sighted field, but not of the blind field (in which he made the
same discrimination).

</p><p>Imaginary cases are of limited value in such theoretical explorations,
but this time I think the flight of fancy nicely reveals how Block mis-locates
the issues. It is not that we others are "conflating" two sorts of consciousness;
it is that he is inflating differences in degree into imaginary differences
in kind.
