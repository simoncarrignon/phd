_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Adds a scale to an existing map, both as a ratio and a distance
     gauge.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     map.scale(x, y, relwidth = 0.15, metric = TRUE, ratio = TRUE, ...)
     
_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

       x:

       y: Location of left end of distance gauge.  If not specified,
          this will be taken to be near the lower left corner of the
          map.

relwidth: Proportion of width of display to be used for the scale.  The
          default is 0.15 (15%).

  metric: If ‘TRUE’, the distance gauge will be in km, otherwise miles.

   ratio: If ‘FALSE’, the scale ratio of the map is not displayed.

     ...: Further plotting parameters may be specified as for the
          command text().

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     The scale is calculated from the displayed graph's plotting
     parameters, and the latitude of the location at which the distance
     gauge will be displayed.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     The exact calculated scale is returned.

_N_O_T_E:

     This function is meaningful only if no projection= has been
     specified in the call to map().

_S_i_d_e _E_f_f_e_c_t_s:

     A scale is added to the currently displayed map. This takes the
     form of an approximate 1:n scale (containing 2-3 significant
     digits), above a distance gauge which is reasonably accurate for
     the latitude at which it appears.  The circumference at the given
     latitude is interpolated from a radius of 6356.78 km at the pole
     and 6378.16 km at the equator.

_S_e_e _A_l_s_o:

     ‘map.axes’

_E_x_a_m_p_l_e_s:

     map("world", "China")
     map.scale()
