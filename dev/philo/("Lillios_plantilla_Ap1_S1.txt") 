_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     This function reads one or several trees in a NEXUS file.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     read.nexus(file, tree.names = NULL)
     
_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

    file: a file name specified by either a variable of mode character,
          or a double-quoted string.

tree.names: if there are several trees to be read, a vector of mode
          character giving names to the individual trees (by default,
          this uses the labels in the NEXUS file if these are present).

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     The present implementation tries to follow as much as possible the
     NEXUS standard (but see the restriction below on TRANSLATION
     tables). Only the block ``TREES'' is read; the other data can be
     read with other functions (e.g., ‘read.dna’, ‘read.table’, ...).

     If a TRANSLATION table is present it is assumed that only the tip
     labels are translated and they are all translated with integers
     without gap. Consequently, if nodes have labels in the tree(s)
     they are read as they are and not looked for in the translation
     table. The logic behind this is that in the vast majority of
     cases, node labels will be support values rather than proper taxa
     names. This is consistent with ‘write.nexus’ which translates only
     the tip labels.

     `read.nexus' tries to represent correctly trees with a badly
     represented root edge (i.e. with an extra pair of parentheses).
     For instance, the tree "((A:1,B:1):10);" will be read like
     "(A:1,B:1):10;" but a warning message will be issued in the former
     case as this is apparently not a valid Newick format. If there are
     two root edges (e.g., "(((A:1,B:1):10):10);"), then the tree is
     not read and an error message is issued.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     an object of class ‘"phylo"’ or of class ‘"multiPhylo"’.

_A_u_t_h_o_r(_s):

     Emmanuel Paradis

_R_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e_s:

     an extensible file format for systematic information. _Systematic
     Biology_, *46*, 590-621.

     ‘write.nexus.data’
