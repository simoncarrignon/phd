stock-D	The number of items of product D a trader puts in his stock in this turn as a result of an unsuccessful transaction or for redistribution in the next turn	
maximum-stock-size	The number of items a trader is willing to obtain through trade this turn in addition to his own demand if the average demand is higher than his demand	
price	The price a trader believes an item is worth based on his knowledge of supply and demand on the market	
demand	The proportion of the demand at the market the trader is located at that he aims to satisfy by obtaining products through trade	Constant increase of 1 per turn; maximum = max-demand
