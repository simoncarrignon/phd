	abstract = "This paper establishes a link between the challenge of solv- ing highly ambitious problems in machine learning and the goal of reproducing the dynamics of open-ended evolution in artiﬁcial life. A major problem with the objective function in machine learning is that through deception it may actu- ally prevent the objective from being reached. In a similar way, selection in evolution may sometimes act to discourage increasing complexity. This paper proposes a single idea that both overcomes the obstacle of deception and suggests a sim- ple new approach to open-ended evolution: Instead of either explicitly seeking an objective or modeling a domain to cap- ture the open-endedness of natural evolution, the idea is to simply search for novelty. Even in an objective-based prob- lem, such novelty search ignores the objective and searches for behavioral novelty. Yet because many points in the search space collapse to the same point in behavior space, it turns out that the search for novelty is computationally feasible. Furthermore, because there are only so many simple behav- iors, the search for novelty leads to increasing complexity. In fact, on the way up the ladder of complexity, the search is likely to encounter at least one solution. In this way, by de- coupling the idea of open-ended search from only artiﬁcial life worlds, the raw search for novelty can be applied to real world problems. Counterintuitively, in the deceptive maze navigation task in this paper, novelty search signiﬁcantly out- performs objective-based search, suggesting a surprising new approach to machine learning.",

	abstract = "Subjects made fast, discrete elbow flexion movements while simultaneously producing rhythmical oscillations about initial and final visual targets embedded on a horizontal surface. Based on kinematic and electromyographic (EMG) analysis, we found that the discrete movement could start at any phase of the cyclical movement. The most likely onset time occurred when the first agonist burst started at the same moment as a rhythmical burst would have appeared. This resulted in a smooth conjugation between discrete and rhythmical movements. The initiation of the discrete movement was associated with the resetting of the phase of the rhythmical movements. Thus, the time characteristics of the two motor tasks were interdependent. A subset of trials with a uniform distribution of discrete movement onset phases could be selected in most subjects and was averaged to eliminate the cyclical component from the combined movement. Mean kinematic and EMG traces up until the peak velocity were practically identical to those of the discrete movement made alone. The averaging procedure was ineffective in eliminating the rhythmical component following the discrete movement because of the resetting of the phase of oscillation. Using the same procedure it has been shown that initiating the rhythmical movement at the same time as beginning the discrete movement did not affect the initial part of discrete movement. The whole discrete movement was not affected when subjects simultaneously terminated the ongoing rhythmical movements. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that although the rhythmical movement constrains the onset time of discrete movement, the latter, once initiated, proceeds independently of the ongoing rhythmical movement. We also subtracted the discrete component from the combined movement to see how the former affected the rhythmical movement. The residual pattern showed that the rhythmical movements rapidly attenuated when the discrete movement started and then apparently resumed after the peak velocity of the discrete movement. The results corroborate the hypothesis that the control signals underlying the two motor tasks cannot be applied simultaneously, since they may be associated with conflicting stability requirements. Instead, these control signals may be generated sequentially, but the resulting kinematic responses may outlast them and be superposed.",

	abstract = "Previous work using electrical microstimulation has suggested the existence of modules subserving limb posture in the spinal cord. In this study, the question of modular organization was reinvestigated with the more selective method of chemical microstimulation. N-methyl–aspartate (NMDA) iontophoresis was applied to 229 sites of the lumbar spinal cord gray while monitoring the isometric force output of the ipsilateral hindlimb at the ankle. A force response was elicited from 69 sites. At 18 of these sites, tonic forces were generated and rhythmic forces at 44. In the case of tonic forces, their directions clustered along four orientations: lateral extension, rostral flexion, adduction, and caudal extension. For the entire set of forces (tonic and rhythmic), the same clusters of orientations were found with the addition of a cluster directed as a flexion toward the body. This distribution of force orientations was quite comparable to that obtained with electrical stimulation at the same sites. The map of tonic responses revealed a topographic organization; each type of force orientation was elicited from sites that grouped together in zones at distinct rostrocaudal and depth locations. In the case of rhythmic sequences of force orientations, some were distinctly more common, whereas others were rarely elicited by NMDA. Mapping of the most common rhythms showed that each was elicited from two or three regions of the cord. These regions were close in location to the tonic regions that produced those forces that represented components specific to that rhythm. There was an additional caudal region from which the different rhythms also could be elicited. Taken together, these results support the concept of a modular organization of the motor system in the frog's spinal cord and delineate the topography of these modules. They also suggest that these modules are used by the circuitry underlying rhythmic pattern generation by the spinal cord.",

	abstract = "This work deals with the application of multi-robot systems to real tasks and, in particular, their coordination through interaction based control systems. Within this field, the practical solutions that have been implemented in real robots mainly use strongly coordinated architectures and assignment strategies because of reliability and fault tolerance issues when addressing problems in reality. Emergent approaches have also been proposed with limited success, basically due to the unpredictability of the behaviors obtained. Here, an emergent approach, called r-ASiCo, is presented containing a procedure to produce predictable solutions and thus avoiding the typical problems associated with these techniques. The r-ASico algorithm is the real time version of the Asynchronous Situated Co-evolution algorithm (ASiCo), which exploits natural open-ended evolution to generate emergent complex collective behaviors and deals with systems made up of a huge number of elements and nonlinear interactions. The goal of r-ASiCo is to design the global behavior desired for the robot team as a collective entity and allow the emergence of behaviors through the interaction of the team members using social rules they learn to implement. To this end, r-ASiCo manages a series of features that are inherent to natural evolution based methods such as energy exchange and mating selection procedures, together with a technique to guide the evolution towards a design objective, the principled evaluation function selection procedure. Hence, this paper presents the components and operation of r-ASiCo and illustrates its application through a collective cleaning task example. It was implemented using 8 e-puck robots in two different real scenarios and its results complemented with those of a 30 e-puck case. The results show the capabilities of r-ASiCo to create a self-organized and adaptive multi-robot system configuration that is tolerant to environmental changes and to failures within the robot team.",

	abstract = "We introduce Embodied Evolution (EE) as a new methodology for evolutionary robotics (ER). EE uses a population of physical robots that autonomously reproduce with one another while situated in their task environment. This constitutes a fully distributed evolutionary algorithm embodied in physical robots. Several issues identified by researchers in the evolutionary robotics community as problematic for the development of ER are alleviated by the use of a large number of robots being evaluated in parallel. Particularly, EE avoids the pitfalls of the simulate-and-transfer method and allows the speed-up of evaluation time by utilizing parallelism. The more novel features of EE are that the evolutionary algorithm is entirely decentralized, which makes it inherently scalable to large numbers of robots, and that it uses many robots in a shared task environment, which makes it an interesting platform for future work in collective robotics and Artificial Life. We have built a population of eight robots and successfully implemented the first example of Embodied Evolution by designing a fully decentralized, asynchronous evolutionary algorithm. Controllers evolved by EE outperform a hand-designed controller in a simple application. We introduce our approach and its motivations, detail our implementation and initial results, and discuss the advantages and limitations of EE.",

Cambridge University Press, Cambridge] operating on an infinite population of pure-strategists. Here, we consider stochastic replicator dynamics, operating on a finite population of pure-strategists playing games similar to HD; in particular, we examine the transient behavior of the system, before it enters an absorbing state due to sampling error. Though stochastic replication prevents the population from fixing onto the PFE, selection always favors the under-represented strategy. Thus, we may naively expect that the mean population state (of the pre-absorption transient) will correspond to the PFE. The empirical results of Fogel et al. [1997. On the instability of evolutionary stable states. BioSystems 44, 135-152] show that the mean population state, in fact, deviates from the PFE with statistical significance. We provide theoretical results that explain their observations. We show that such deviation away from the PFE occurs when the selection pressures that surround the fitness-equilibrium point are asymmetric. Further, we analyze a Markov model to prove that a finite population will generate a distribution over population states that equilibrates selection-pressure asymmetry; the mean of this distribution is generally not the fitness-equilibrium state.",

Our simulation points out that: (1) each robot is able not only to act as an autonomous agent, but also to interact with others to be beyond the individual capabilities; (2) in order to adapt to changes in the environment, each robot is situated as an adaptive agent in a network of neighboring robots, which leads to a state of energy autonomy.

From the routing of traffic in telecommunication networks to the design of control algorithms for groups of autonomous robots, the collective behaviors of these animals have inspired many of the foundational works in this emerging research field. For the first issue of this journal dedicated to swarm intelligence, we review the main biological principles that underlie the organization of insects’ colonies. We begin with some reminders about the decentralized nature of such systems and we describe the underlying mechanisms of complex collective behaviors of social insects, from the concept of stigmergy to the theory of self-organization in biological systems. We emphasize in particular the role of interactions and the importance of bifurcations that appear in the collective output of the colony when some of the system’s parameters change. We then propose to categorize the collective behaviors displayed by insect colonies according to four functions that emerge at the level of the colony and that organize its global behavior. Finally, we address the role of modulations of individual behaviors by disturbances (either environmental or internal to the colony) in the overall flexibility of insect colonies. We conclude that future studies about self-organized biological behaviors should investigate such modulations to better understand how insect colonies adapt to uncertain worlds.",

It is believed that many species originated through allopatric divergence, where new species arise from geographically isolated populations of the same ancestral species. In contrast, the possibility of sympatric speciation (in which new species arise without geographical isolation) has often been dismissed, partly because of theoretical difficulties. Most previous models analysing sympatric speciation concentrated on particular aspects of the problem while neglecting others. Here we present a model that integrates a novel combination of different features and show that sympatric speciation is a likely outcome of competition for resources. We use multilocus genetics to describe sexual reproduction in an individual-based model, and we consider the evolution of assortative mating (where individuals mate preferentially with like individuals) depending either on an ecological character affecting resource use or on a selectively neutral marker trait. In both cases, evolution of assortative mating often leads to reproductive isolation between ecologically diverging subpopulations. When assortative mating depends on a marker trait, and is therefore not directly linked to resource competition, speciation occurs when genetic drift breaks the linkage equilibrium between the marker and the ecological trait. Our theory conforms well with mounting empirical evidence for the sympatric origin of many species.",

	abstract = "We present a general framework for modelling adaptive trait dynamics in which we integrate various concepts and techniques from modern ESS-theory. The concept of evolutionarily singular strategies is introduced as a generalization of the ESS-concept. We give a full classification of the singular strategies in terms of ESS-stability, convergence stability, the ability of the singular strategy to invade other populations if initially rare itself, and the possibility of protected dimorphisms occurring within the singular strategy's neighbourhood. Of particular interest is a type of singular strategy that is an evolutionary attractor from a great distance, but once in its neighbourhood a population becomes dimorphic and undergoes disruptive selection leading to evolutionary branching. Modelling the adaptive growth and branching of the evolutionary tree can thus be considered as a major application of the framework. A haploid version of Levene's ‘soft selection’ model is developed as a specific example to demonstrate evolutionary dynamics and branching in monomorphic and polymorphic populations.",

	abstract = {The efficiency of social insect colonies critically depends on their ability to efficiently allocate workers to the various tasks which need to be performed. While numerous models have investigated the mechanisms allowing an efficient colony response to external changes in the environment and internal perturbations, little attention has been devoted to the genetic architecture underlying task specialisation. We used artificial evolution to compare the performances of three simple genetic architectures underlying within colony variation in response thresholds of workers to five tasks. In the "deterministic mapping" system, the thresholds of individuals for each of the five tasks is strictly genetically determined. In the second genetic architecture ("probabilistic mapping"), the genes only influence the probability of engaging in one of the tasks. Finally, in the "dynamic mapping" system, the propensity of workers to engage in one of the five tasks depends not only on their own genotype but also on the behavioural phenotypes of other colony members. We found that the deterministic mapping system performed well only when colonies consist of unrelated individuals and are not subjected to perturbations in task allocation. The probabilistic mapping system performed well for colonies of related and unrelated individuals when there were no perturbations. Finally, the dynamic mapping system performed well under all conditions and was much more efficient than the two other mapping systems when there were perturbations. Overall, our simulations reveal that the type of mapping between genotype and individual behaviour greatly influences the dynamics of task specialisation and colony productivity. Our simulations also reveal complex interactions between the mode of mapping, level of within colony relatedness and risk of colony perturbations.},

	abstract = "{ Social insects–ants, bees, termites, and wasps–can be viewed as powerful problem-solving systems with sophisticated collective intelligence. Composed of simple interacting agents, this intelligence lies in the networks of interactions among individuals and between individuals and the<br>environment. A fascinating subject, social insects are also a powerful metaphor for artificial intelligence, and the problems they solve–finding food, dividing labor among nestmates, building nests, responding to external challenges–have important counterparts in engineering and computer science. <br> <br>This book provides a detailed look at models of social insect behavior and how to apply these models in the design of complex systems. The book shows how these models replace an emphasis on control, preprogramming, and centralization with designs featuring autonomy, emergence, and distributed<br>functioning. These designs are proving immensely flexible and robust, able to adapt quickly to changing environments and to continue functioning even when individual elements fail. In particular, these designs are an exciting approach to the tremendous growth of complexity in software and<br>information. Swarm Intelligence draws on up-to-date research from biology, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, robotics, operations research, and computer graphics, and each chapter is organized around a particular biological example, which is then used to develop an algorithm, a multiagent<br>system, or a group of robots. The book will be an invaluable resource for a broad range of disciplines. }",

This model is translation-invariant and supports eﬃcient bottom-up and top-down probabilistic inference. Key to our approach is probabilistic max-pooling, a novel technique which shrinks the representations of higher layers in a probabilistically sound way. Our experiments show that the algorithm learns useful high-level visual features, such as ob- ject parts, from unlabeled images of objects and natural scenes. We demonstrate excel- lent performance on several visual recogni- tion tasks and show that our model can per- form hierarchical (bottom-up and top-down) inference over full-sized images.",

The experiment involved human players who have been given the task of conducting specific military operations within a scenario. The motivation for developing measures for situation awareness was to gain the ability to evaluate the impact of decision support tools and visualisation aids. The ability to measure situation awareness also provides a tool for studying command performance, specifically command appreciation of the situation. The method used to measure situation awareness was SAGAT (Situation Awareness Global Assessment Technique) (Endsley, 1995b). This involved the freezing of the exercise at random times, during which the subjects had to respond to questions relating to the three levels of situation awareness (perception, comprehension and projection). SAGAT has been employed in the air domain for many years. Its implementation in the land force has been at the lower echelon activities. This work was undertaken to assess the viability of the method in a C2 environment at the Brigade level. It was concluded that the technique is potentially very useful. Possible improvements in the implementation of the technique are discussed.",

For its first three billion years, life on Earth was a world of microscopic forms, rarely achieving a size greater than a millimetre or a complexity beyond two or three cell types. But in the past 600 million years, the evolution of much larger and more complex organisms has transformed the biosphere. Despite their disparate forms and physiologies, the evolution and diversification of plants, animals, fungi and other macroforms has followed similar global trends. One of the most important features underlying evolutionary increases in animal and plant size, complexity and diversity has been their modular construction from reiterated parts. Although simple filamentous and spherical forms may evolve wherever cellular life exists, the evolution of motile, modular mega-organisms might not be a universal pattern.",

	abstract = "We have previously reported that focal intraspinal N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) iontophoresis in the frog elicits a motor output, which is organized in terms of its constituent isometric force directions at the ipsilateral ankle and its topography. Furthermore, the associated EMG patterns can be reconstructed as the linear combinations of seven muscle synergies, labeled A to G. We now focus on one of the most common NMDA-elicited outputs, the adduction-caudal extension-flexion rhythm, and examine the relationship between the different force phases in terms of synergies and topography. Two distinct EMG patterns produce caudal extensions, and only one of the two patterns is used at most sites. The key synergy combinations for the two patterns are B + e and D + c (strongest synergies capitalized). These two patterns map at distinct locations in the lumbar cord. Within individual sites rhythms, we find linkages among the synergies used to produce adductions, the onsets of flexions after caudal extensions, and the synergy pattern producing the caudal extensions. For example, the synergy composition of adductions at B + e caudal extension sites is dominated by E + b and at D + c caudal extension sites by C + d. The two types of adductions map at distinct locations, situated between the two caudal extension regions. Specifically the linked patterns of caudal extension-adduction interleave rostrocaudally in a CE2-ADD1-ADD2-CE1 sequence, where 1 and 2 refer to the two pattern types. The implications of this topography and connectivity with respect to motor systems organization and behaviors are discussed.",

This paper mathematically discusses sustained oscillations generated by mutual inhibition of the neurons which are represented by a continuous-variable model with a kind of fatigue or adaptation effect. If the neural network has no stable stationary state for constant input stimuli, it will generate and sustain some oscillation for any initial state and for any disturbance. Some sufficient conditions for that are given to three types of neural networks: lateral inhibition networks of linearly arrayed neurons, symmetric inhibition networks and cyclic inhibition networks. The result suggests that the adaptation of the neurons plays a very important role for the appearance of the oscillations. Some computer simulations of rhythmic activities are also presented for cyclic inhibition networks consisting of a few neurons.",

Our new implementation of the algorithm, termed (1+1)-restart-online algorithm, addresses this issue and has been successfully exper- imented using a Cortex M3 microcontroller connected to a realistic robot simulator as well as within an autonomous robot based on an Atmel ATmega128 microcon- troller. Results from the experiments show that the new algorithm is able to escape local optima and to perform behavior optimization in a complete autonomous fash- ion. As a consequence, it is able to converge faster and provides a richer set of relevant controllers compared to the previous implementation.",

@Article{ holmgren07artificialneuralnetworksmodelsspecializationguildevolutionsympatricspeciation,
	abstract = "Sympatric speciation can arise as a result of disruptive selection with assortative mating as a pleiotropic by-product. Studies on host choice, employing artificial neural networks as models for the host recognition system in exploiters, illustrate how disruptive selection on host choice coupled with assortative mating can arise as a consequence of selection for specialization. Our studies demonstrate that a generalist exploiter population can evolve into a guild of specialists with an 'ideal free' frequency distribution across hosts. The ideal free distribution arises from variability in host suitability and density-dependent exploiter fitness on different host species. Specialists are less subject to inter-phenotypic competition than generalists and to harmful mutations that are common in generalists exploiting multiple hosts. When host signals used as cues by exploiters coevolve with exploiter recognition systems, our studies show that evolutionary changes may be continuous and cyclic. Selection changes back and forth between specialization and generalization in the exploiters, and weak and strong mimicry in the hosts, where non-defended hosts use the host investing in defence as a model. Thus, host signals and exploiter responses are engaged in a red-queen mimicry process that is ultimately cyclic rather then directional. In one phase, evolving signals of exploitable hosts mimic those of hosts less suitable for exploitation (i.e. the model). Signals in the model hosts also evolve through selection to escape the mimic and its exploiters. Response saturation constraints in the model hosts lead to the mimic hosts finally perfecting its mimicry, after which specialization in the exploiter guild is lost. This loss of exploiter specialization provides an opportunity for the model hosts to escape their mimics. Therefore, this cycle then repeats. We suggest that a species can readily evolve sympatrically when disruptive selection for specialization on hosts is the first step. In a sexual reproduction setting, partial reproductive isolation may first evolve by mate choice being confined to individuals on the same host. Secondly, this disruptive selection will favour assortative mate choice on genotype, thereby leading to increased reproductive isolation.",

	abstract = "Motivated in part by the hierarchical organization of the cortex, a number of al- gorithms have recently been proposed that try to learn hierarchical, or “deep,” structure from unlabeled data. While several authors have formally or informally compared their algorithms to computations performed in visual area V1 (and the cochlea), little attempt has been made thus far to evaluate these algorithms in terms of their ﬁdelity for mimicking computations at deeper levels in the cortical hier- archy. This paper presents an unsupervised learning model that faithfully mimics certain properties of visual area V2. Speciﬁcally, we develop a sparse variant of the deep belief networks of Hinton et al. (2006). We learn two layers of nodes in the network, and demonstrate that the ﬁrst layer, similar to prior work on sparse coding and ICA, results in localized, oriented, edge ﬁlters, similar to the Gabor functions known to model V1 cell receptive ﬁelds. Further, the second layer in our model encodes correlations of the ﬁrst layer responses in the data. Speciﬁcally, it picks up both colinear (“contour”) features as well as corners and junctions. More interestingly, in a quantitative comparison, the encoding of these more complex “corner” features matches well with the results from the Ito & Komatsu’s study of biological V2 responses. This suggests that our sparse variant of deep belief networks holds promise for modeling more higher-order features.",

However, genetic variation aiding the sympatric radiation of the group in the United States may have geographic roots. Inversions on chromosomes 1–3 affecting diapause traits adapting ﬂies to differences in host fruiting phenology appear to exist in the United States because of a series of secondary introgression events from Mexico. Here, we investigate whether these inverted regions of the genome may have subsequently evolved to become more recalcitrant to introgression relative to collinear regions, consistent with new models for chromosomal speciation. As predicted by the models, gene trees for six nuclear loci mapping to chromosomes other than 1–3 tended to have shallower node depths separating Mexican and U.S. haplotypes relative to an outgroup sequence than nine genes residing on chromosomes 1–3. We discuss the implications of secondary contact and differential introgression with respect to sympatric host race formation and speciation in Rhagoletis, reconciling some of the seemingly dichotomous views of Mayr, Dobzhansky, and Bush concerning modes of divergence",

Specialisation and cooperation results from an evolutionary process in which selection and reproduction is based on individual fitness. Specialists come to help (through the donation of resources) their non-kin group members, optimising their behaviour as a team and producing a fitter group. The mechanism that promotes this benevolent, cooperative group behaviour is based on the concept of a \"tag\". Tags are observable markings, cues or displays. Individuals can observe the tags of others and take alternative actions based on those observations (e.g. to altruistically help or not). We show that even random (or dumb) searching for appropriate partners produces significant levels of specialisation and cooperation.

We compare nonmodular feed-forward network, a hardwired modular, and a duplication-based modular motor control network. We conclude that both modular architectures outperform the non-modular architecture, both in terms of rate of adaptation as well as the level of adaptation achieved. The main difference between the hardwired and duplication-based modular architectures is that in the latter the modules reached a much higher degree of functional specialization otheir motor control units with regard to high-level behaviorafunctions. The hardwired architectures reach the same level of performance, but have a more distributed assignment of functional tasks to the motor control units. We conclude thathe mechanism through which functional specialization is achieved is similar to the mechanism proposed for the evolution of duplicated genes. It is found that the duplicatioof multifunctional modules rst leads to a change in the regulation of the module, leading to a differentiation of the functional context in which the module is used. Then the module adapts to the new functional context. After this second step the system is locked into a functionally specialized state. We suggest that functional specialization may be an evolutionary absorption state.",

This framework learns a set of features that can generate the images of a speciﬁc object class. Our fea- ture extraction model is a four layer hierarchy of alternat- ing ﬁltering and maximum subsampling. We learn feature parameters of the ﬁrst and third layers viewing them as sep- arate C-RBMs. The outputs of our feature extraction hier- archy are then fed as input to a discriminative classiﬁer.

Although GASP mutants are competitors with wild-type bacteria, we find that the 2 strains cooperate to maximize fitness (long-term total productivity) via spatial segregation: despite their very close genomic kinship, wild-type populations associate with wild-type populations and GASP populations with GASP populations. Thus, wild-type and GASP strains avoid each other locally, yet fitness is enhanced for both strains globally. This computation of fitness enhancement emerges from the local interaction among cells but maximizes global densities. At present we do not understand how fluctuations in both spatial and temporal dimensions lead to the emergent computation and how multilevel aggregates produce this collective adaptation.",

Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks 'rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them 'small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon13,14 (popularly known as six degrees of separation15). The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability.

A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions, which indicates that the development of large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.",

@Book{ kauffman96homeunivsearlawsselfcomp,
	abstract = {{The best treatment I have yet encountered about how order emerges naturally – and possibly even necessarily – out of chaos. Profoundly important, and considerably more informed than better-known pop-science treatments of chaos theory. Very highly recommended.} {A major scientific revolution has begun, a new paradigm that rivals Darwin's theory in importance. At its heart is the discovery of the order that lies deep within the most complex of systems, from the origin of life, to the workings of giant corporations, to the rise and fall of great civilizations. And more than anyone else, this revolution is the work of one man, Stuart Kauffman, a MacArthur Fellow and visionary pioneer of the new science of complexity. Now, in At Home in the Universe, Kauffman brilliantly weaves together the excitement of intellectual discovery and a fertile mix of insights to give the general reader a fascinating look at this new science–and at the forces for order that lie at the edge of chaos. <P>What we are now only discovering, Kauffman says, is that range of spontaneous order is enormously greater than we had supposed and, in fact, self-organization is a great undiscovered principle of nature. He contends that complexity itself triggers self-organization–what Kauffman calls "order for free"–and that if enough different molecules pass a certain threshold of complexity, they begin to self-organize into a new entity: a living cell. There is a phase transition when water abruptly turns to ice. Likewise, life may have originated when the mix of different molecules in the primordial soup passed a certain level of complexity and re-grouped into living entities (if so, then life is not a highly improbable chance event, but almost inevitable). Using the basic insight of "order for free" Kauffman illuminates a staggering range of phenomena. Darwin's natural selection has not acted alone, but in a persistent marriage with self-organization to create the majesty of the biosphere. A new slant can also be applied to the field of genetic engineering wherein trillions of novel molecules can be generated to find new drugs, vaccines, and enzymes. Kauffman extends this new paradigm to economic and cultural systems, showing that all may evolve according to similar general laws. <P>An exciting exploration into the nature of life, At Home in the Universe provides stunning insights into a new scientific revolution.}},

The nal behavior of the agent is the result of the global activity of this loop and every weakeness or incoherence of a single element has strong consequences on the performances of the agent. We think that, for the purpose of building autonomous robots, all these elements need to be developed together in continuous interaction with the environment. We describe the implementation of a possible solution (arti cial neural networks and genetic algorithms) on a real mobile robot through a set of three di erent experiments. We focus our attention on three di erent aspects of the control structure: perception, internal representation and action. In all the experiments these aspects are not considered as single processing elements, but as part of an agent. For every experiment, the advantages and disadvantages of this approach are presented and discussed. The results show that the combination of genetic algorithms and neural networks is a very interesting technique for the development of control structures in autonomous agents. The time necessary for evolution, on the other hand, is a very important limitation of the evolutionary approach.",

Making use of Wright's Coefficient of Relationship as the measure of the proportion of replica genes in a relative, a quantity is found which incorporates the maximizing property of Darwinian fitness. This quantity is named \"inclusive fitness\". Species following the model should tend to evolve behaviour such that each organism appears to be attempting to maximize its inclusive fitness. This implies a limited restraint on selfish competitive behaviour and possibility of limited self-sacrifices. Special cases of the model are used to show (a) that selection in the social situations newly covered tends to be slower than classical selection, (b) how in populations of rather non-dispersive organisms the model may apply to genes affecting dispersion, and (c) how it may apply approximately to competition between relatives, for example, within sibships. Some artificialities of the model are discussed.},

To this end, in this work we have applied a co-evolutionary algorithm called ASiCo (Asynchronous Situated Co-evolution) which is based on an open-ended evolution of the robots in their environment. In this environment the robots are born, mate and die throughout the generations as in an artificial life system. In order to show that ASiCo is capable of obtaining species automatically if they are advantageous, here we apply it to a collective gathering and construction task where homogeneous teams are suboptimal.",
