Furthermore, simulation techniques promise to provide theoreticians in various fields with entirely new conceptual, as well as methodological, approaches. However, the precise manner in which simulations can be used as models is not clear. We present two apparently opposed perspectives on this issue: simulation models as \" emergent computational thought experiments\" and simulation models as realistic simulacra. Through analysing the role that armchair thought experiments play in science, we develop a role for simulation models as opaque thought experiments, that is, thought experiments in which the consequences follow from the premises, but in a non-obvious m...} }},

On one proposal, experiments investigate nature directly, while simulations merely investigate models. On another proposal, simulations differ from experiments in that simulationists manipulate objects that bear only a formal (rather than material) similarity to the targets of their investigations. Both of these proposals are rejected.

	abstract = "(1) A model of population regulation by emigration is developed based on (i) spatial and temporal heterogeneity of natural environments; (ii) unequal resource partitioning among individuals of single species populations. This latter phenomenon has not previously been taken into account by theoretical ecologists, although it is of basic importance for regulation of population density. (2) Unequal resource partitioning increases the stability of a confined population and allows emigration of some population members into suboptimal and hostile areas to evolve by individual selection. (3) In a local habitat supplied by a constant inflow of food, animal density is lower and food density is higher when emigration occurs, than without emigration. (4) Regulation of population density by emigration allows for the adjustment of this density to the amount of food, in such a way that mortality is not directly due to food shortage but to other agents (predators, adverse weather conditions, etc.). (5) Animals with overlapping generations and cyclic changes in population density can emigrate at lower density level, than that determined by food supply at any given point in time. At high densities such populations can also exhibit reduced reproduction, which under certain circumstances can be considered as an adaptation. (6) Population outbreaks are thought of as a failure of population regulation by emigration resulting from spatial homogeneity of the environment. Homogeneity diminishes both differences among individuals in local populations and differences between local habitats and their surroundings, these in turn can make regulation by emigration impossible.",

	abstract = "Abstract It has often been suggested that innate features of the human mind could make some cultural forms more successful than others. This paper presents a case study consistent with this ``cognitive attraction'' hypothesis. Numerous studies show that direct eye-gaze catches the attention of adults and newborns. Adults find it more attractive. We explore one possible cultural consequence of this cognitive appeal. Among \{XVIth\} century European portraits, direct-gaze paintings are more likely to be featured in today's art books. In Renaissance Europe, the proportion of paintings that stare at the viewer grows gradually, strongly, and remains prevalent for centuries. A demographic analysis of this shift shows that it was due to the arrival of new generations of painters. Those artists show a preference for direct-gaze portraits as soon as they start painting, suggesting that they acquired the new style in the years of their apprenticeship. The preferences of those painters and of contemporary art critics seem consistent with the innate attentional bias that favours direct-gaze faces. The structure of the ``Renaissance gaze shift'' bears evidence for the importance of demographic turn-over in cultural change.",

This theory allows us to predict the distribution of surnames, and to predict immigration on the basis of knowledge of population size, and of the total number of different surnames or, in lieu of the latter, a quantity known as random isonymy. Another approach allows us to predict probabilities of extinction after any number of generations and various sets of conditions.

Although simple, the model can reproduce a lot of the stylized facts of business cycles. The author argues that agent-based modeling is an adequate response to the recently expressed criticism of macroeconomic methodology because it allows for aggregate behavior that is more than simply a replication of microeconomic optimization decisions in equilibrium. At the same time it allows for absolutely consistent microfoundations, including the structure and properties of markets. Most importantly, it does not depend on equilibrium assumptions or fictitious auctioneers and does therefore not rule out coordination failures, instability and crisis by definition. A situation that is very close to a general equilibrium can instead be shown to result endogenously from non-rational micro interaction.",

One of the most prominent framing effects is the tendency for decision makers to evaluate gambles relative to a reference point, and to act risk-seeking when prospects are framed as losses but risk-averse when identical prospects are framed as gains. This tendency for risk-preferences to reverse between loss and gain frames has been termed the reflection effect, and is one of the primary predictions of Prospect Theory. Here, we explore whether non-human primates exhibit a similar reflection effect. Using a token-trading task, we show that capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella) exhibit an analogous reversal of risk preferences depending on whether outcomes are presented as gains or losses, suggesting that similar framing effects also influence choice in non-human primates. This finding suggests that the mechanisms that drive framing effects in humans may be evolutionarily ancient, extending broadly across the primate order.",

Choices among risky prospects exhibit several pervasive effects that are inconsistent with the basic tenets of utility theory. In particular, people underweight outcomes that are merely probable in comparison with outcomes that are obtained with certainty. This tendency, called the certainty effect, contributes to risk aversion in choices involving sure gains and to risk seeking in choices involving sure losses. In addition, people generally discard components that are shared by all prospects under consideration. This tendency, called the isolation effect, leads to inconsistent preferences when the same choice is presented in different forms. An alternative theory of choice is developed, in which value is assigned to gains and losses rather than to final assets and in which probabilities are replaced by decision weights. The value function is normally concave for gains, commonly convex for losses, and is generally steeper for losses than for gains. Decision weights are generally lower than the corresponding probabilities, except in the range of low probabilities. Overweighting of low probabilities may contribute to the attractiveness of both insurance and gambling.",

Such biases are demonstrated in the judged frequency of classes of words, of combinatorial outcomes, and of repeated events.

@article{macy2002fromfactorstoactorscomputationalsociologyandagentbasedmodeling,
	abstract = {Sociologists often model social processes as interactions among variables. We review an alternative approach that models social life as interactions among adaptive agents who influence one another in response to the influence they receive. These agent-based models (ABMs) show how simple and predictable local interactions can generate familiar but enigmatic global patterns, such as the diffusion of information, emergence of norms, coordination of conventions, or participation in collective action. Emergent social patterns can also appear unexpectedly and then just as dramatically transform or disappear, as happens in revolutions, market crashes, fads, and feeding frenzies. ABMs provide theoretical leverage where the global patterns of interest are more than the aggregation of individual attributes, but at the same time, the emergent pattern cannot be understood without a bottom up dynamical model of the microfoundations at the relational level. We begin with a brief historical sketch of the shift from "factors" to "actors" in computational sociology that shows how agent-based modeling differs fundamentally from earlier sociological uses of computer simulation. We then review recent contributions focused on the emergence of social structure and social order out of local interaction. Although sociology has lagged behind other social sciences in appreciating this new methodology, a distinctive sociological contribution is evident in the papers we review. First, theoretical interest focuses on dynamic social networks that shape and are shaped by agent interaction. Second, ABMs are used to perform virtual experiments that test macrosociological theories by manipulating structural factors like network topology, social stratification, or spatial mobility. We conclude our review with a series of recommendations for realizing the rich sociological potential of this approach.},

	abstract = "The study of material culture generated by military engagements has created an emergent sub-discipline of archaeological studies centred on battlefields. This approach has developed a particular and sophisticated methodology that is able to deal with the fact that archaeologists will often not find either structures or a useful stratigraphical record on the site, as the material remains of the battle will basically be metallic objects carried by combatants. It is therefore rather complicated not only to test hypotheses about battle events based on archaeological data, but also to validate the methodology used. Here we propose the use of agent-based models to explore these issues in the case of eighteenth-century battlefield archaeology. The simulation is divided into four different steps. Firstly, a battle is simulated in order to generate realistic virtual archaeological remains left by an engagement between two armies of this era. We then simulate the loss of information that the passing of time produces in the battlefield. The third step involves simulating the archaeological survey, enabling us to explore different survey strategies and the impact on the interpretation of the event itself. Finally, we design a confidence index in order to compare the results of the different virtual excavations using spatial analysis and statistics. The results show that the methodology is fully functional in terms of understanding a battle, and it allows us to suggest new strategies to improve fieldwork and to develop new ways of exploring these particular archaeological sites. It is concluded that the described approach illustrates how simulation can be used to explore methodological issues of archaeological science.",

	abstract = "The evolving field of social simulation is diversifying the degree of complexity of published works, from simple models to large scale simulations with millions of agents. In this context, available platforms are divided between the ones favoring easy to use interfaces and the development of prototyping, and others created for simulating large scenarios with high computing costs. The later group is truly diverse, based on the way executions are accelerate and the wide range of technologies that they can support. The cost of this increase in performance is a steep learning curve, as the users of these platforms need to have advanced programming skills in order to deal with code complexity. Pandora is a novel open-source framework designed to fill the gap between these approaches. A twin interface in Python and C++ offers the same interface to users developing prototypes as well as projects with High-Performance Computing requirements. The need for parallel programming knowledge is also skipped through the automated generation, during compilation time, of needed code for shared and unshared memory distribution using OpenMP and MPI. A set of different helpers (unit testing, georeferencing support) and analytical tools complement the basic framework in order to facilitate the tasks of development, testing and analyzing any type of Agent-Based Model. Pandora\&$\#$39;s flexibility is exemplified through different projects that have introduced GPU acceleration, georeferenced data and cloud computing to the framework.",

@article{shennan2001ceramicstylechangeandneutralevolutionacasestudyfromneolithiceurope,
	abstract = {Following on the work of Dunnell, the evolutionary archaeology school has made a sharp distinction between functional and stylistic variation in archaeological artifacts. Variation is defined as functional if it is affected by selection processes and as stylistic if it is a result of processes of random drift. The argument has been further developed by Neiman (1995), who showed by simulation that processes of cultural mutation and drift could produce the kinds of "battleship curves" that generally characterize artifact-style frequency distributions through time, and also demonstrated that they could account for patterns of stylistic variation through time in Woodland-period ceramic assemblages from Illinois. In this paper we present a case study of change in the decoration of pottery from early Neolithic Central Europe. We show that the actual diachronic frequency distributions and those expected under the neutral model do not coincide and conclude that in this case the neutral model does not provide an adequate description of change in ceramic decoration. A model involving selection, in the form of a bias in favor of novelty in the later phases of the period studied, seems likely to be more appropriate, and we note the social interpretation of the original investigator of the data. In conclusion, it is suggested that neutral models provide an important heuristic tool but that there is not a radical break between functional and stylistic variation.},

@article{scottphillips2014thenicheconstructionperspectiveacriticalappraisal,
	abstract = "Niche construction refers to the activities of organisms that bring about changes in their environments, many of which are evolutionarily and ecologically consequential. Advocates of niche construction theory (NCT) believe that standard evolutionary theory fails to recognize the full importance of niche construction, and consequently propose a novel view of evolution, in which niche construction and its legacy over time (ecological inheritance) are described as evolutionary processes, equivalent in importance to natural selection. Here, we subject NCT to critical evaluation, in the form of a collaboration between one prominent advocate of NCT, and a team of skeptics. We discuss whether niche construction is an evolutionary process, whether NCT obscures or clarifies how natural selection leads to organismal adaptation, and whether niche construction and natural selection are of equivalent explanatory importance. We also consider whether the literature that promotes NCT overstates the significance of niche construction, whether it is internally coherent, and whether it accurately portrays standard evolutionary theory. Our disagreements reflect a wider dispute within evolutionary theory over whether the neo-Darwinian synthesis is in need of reformulation, as well as different usages of some key terms (e.g., evolutionary process).",

	abstract = "Humanity has just crossed a major landmark in its history with the majority of people now living in cities. Cities have long been known to be society's predominant engine of innovation and wealth creation, yet they are also its main source of crime, pollution, and disease. The inexorable trend toward urbanization worldwide presents an urgent challenge for developing a predictive, quantitative theory of urban organization and sustainable development. Here we present empirical evidence indicating that the processes relating urbanization to economic development and knowledge creation are very general, being shared by all cities belonging to the same urban system and sustained across different nations and times. Many diverse properties of cities from patent production and personal income to electrical cable length are shown to be power law functions of population size with scaling exponents, Î², that fall into distinct universality classes. Quantities reflecting wealth creation and innovation have Î² â1.2 >1 (increasing returns), whereas those accounting for infrastructure display Î² â0.8 <1 (economies of scale). We predict that the pace of social life in the city increases with population size, in quantitative agreement with data, and we discuss how cities are similar to, and differ from, biological organisms, for which Î²<1. Finally, we explore possible consequences of these scaling relations by deriving growth equations, which quantify the dramatic difference between growth fueled by innovation versus that driven by economies of scale. This difference suggests that, as population grows, major innovation cycles must be generated at a continually accelerating rate to sustain growth and avoid stagnation or collapse.",

The motivation behind this work is to design algorithms that can cope with unknown environmental pressure, that is to learn (through evolution) efficient survival strategies in order to ad- dress a priori unknown constraints existing in the environ- ment. We are concerned with a fixed-size population of au- tonomous robotic agents facing unknown, possibly changing, environments, which may require the robots to evolve partic- ular behaviors such as cooperative behaviors, specialized be- haviors, etc. We describe a particular flavor of EDEA, termed minimal EDEA (mEDEA), and summarize results obtained so far, both with real robots and in simulation. This algo- rithm is shown to be both efficient in unknown environment and robust with respect to abrupt, unpredicted, and possibly lethal changes in the environment. Moreover, the ability of mEDEA to evolve various types of behavior, including coop- erative and specialized behaviors, is summarized.}",

Recent research, however, suggests that cities are complex systems that mainly grow from the bottom up, their size and shape following well-defined scaling laws that result from intense competition for space. An integrated theory of how cities evolve, linking urban economics and transportation behavior to developments in network science, allometric growth, and fractal geometry, is being slowly developed. This science provides new insights into the resource limits facing cities in terms of the meaning of density, compactness, and sprawl, and related questions of sustainability. It has the potential to enrich current approaches to city planning and replace traditional top-down strategies with realistic city plans that benefit all city dwellers.",
