Against such a backdrop, this report reviews and discusses artificial life, as it is depicted in, and as it interfaces with, adjacent disciplines (in particular, philosophy, biology, and linguistics), and in the light of a specific historical example of interdisciplinary research (namely cybernetics) with which artificial life shares many features. This report grew out of a workshop held at the Sixth European Conference on Artificial Life in Prague and features individual contributions from the workshop{\rq}s eight speakers, plus a section designed to reflect the debates that took place during the workshop{\rq}s discussion sessions. The major theme that emerged during these sessions was the identity and status of artificial life as a scientific endeavor.",

	abstract = "In 1858, two naturalists, Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace, independently proposed natural selection as the basic mechanism responsible for the origin of new phenotypic variants and, ultimately, new species. A large body of evidence for this hypothesis was published in Darwin{\rq}s Origin of Species one year later, the appearance of which provoked other leading scientists like August Weismann to adopt and amplify Darwin{\rq}s perspective. Weismann{\rq}s neo-Darwinian theory of evolution was further elaborated, most notably in a series of books by Theodosius Dobzhansky, Ernst Mayr, Julian Huxley and others. In this article we first summarize the history of life on Earth and provide recent evidence demonstrating that Darwin{\rq}s dilemma (the apparent missing Precambrian record of life) has been resolved. Next, the historical development and structure of the ``modern synthesis'' is described within the context of the following topics: paleobiology and rates of evolution, mass extinctions and species selection, macroevolution and punctuated equilibrium, sexual reproduction and recombination, sexual selection and altruism, endosymbiosis and eukaryotic cell evolution, evolutionary developmental biology, phenotypic plasticity, epigenetic inheritance and molecular evolution, experimental bacterial evolution, and computer simulations (in silico evolution of digital organisms). In addition, we discuss the expansion of the modern synthesis, embracing all branches of scientific disciplines. It is concluded that the basic tenets of the synthetic theory have survived, but in modified form. These sub-theories require continued elaboration, particularly in light of molecular biology, to answer open-ended questions concerning the mechanisms of evolution in all five kingdoms of life.",

	abstract = {{The best treatment I have yet encountered about how order emerges naturally -- and possibly even necessarily -- out of chaos. Profoundly important, and considerably more informed than better-known pop-science treatments of chaos theory. Very highly recommended.} {A major scientific revolution has begun, a new paradigm that rivals Darwin's theory in importance. At its heart is the discovery of the order that lies deep within the most complex of systems, from the origin of life, to the workings of giant corporations, to the rise and fall of great civilizations. And more than anyone else, this revolution is the work of one man, Stuart Kauffman, a MacArthur Fellow and visionary pioneer of the new science of complexity. Now, in At Home in the Universe, Kauffman brilliantly weaves together the excitement of intellectual discovery and a fertile mix of insights to give the general reader a fascinating look at this new science--and at the forces for order that lie at the edge of chaos. What we are now only discovering, Kauffman says, is that range of spontaneous order is enormously greater than we had supposed and, in fact, self-organization is a great undiscovered principle of nature. He contends that complexity itself triggers self-organization--what Kauffman calls "order for free"--and that if enough different molecules pass a certain threshold of complexity, they begin to self-organize into a new entity: a living cell. There is a phase transition when water abruptly turns to ice. Likewise, life may have originated when the mix of different molecules in the primordial soup passed a certain level of complexity and re-grouped into living entities (if so, then life is not a highly improbable chance event, but almost inevitable). Using the basic insight of "order for free" Kauffman illuminates a staggering range of phenomena. Darwin's natural selection has not acted alone, but in a persistent marriage with self-organization to create the majesty of the biosphere. A new slant can also be applied to the field of genetic engineering wherein trillions of novel molecules can be generated to find new drugs, vaccines, and enzymes. Kauffman extends this new paradigm to economic and cultural systems, showing that all may evolve according to similar general laws. An exciting exploration into the nature of life, At Home in the Universe provides stunning insights into a new scientific revolution.}},

@article{barandiaran09definingagencyindividualitynormativityasymmetryspatiotemporalityaction,
	abstract = "The concept of agency is of crucial importance in cognitive science and artificial intelligence, and it is often used as an intuitive and rather uncontroversial term, in contrast to more abstract and theoretically heavily weighted terms such as intentionality , rationality, or mind. However, most of the available definitions of agency are too loose or unspecific to allow for a progressive scientific research program. They implicitly and unproblematically assume the features that characterize agents, thus obscuring the full potential and challenge of modeling agency. We identify three conditions that a system must meet in order to be considered as a genuine agent: (a) a system must define its own individuality, (b) it must be the active source of activity in its environment (interactional asymmetry), and (c) it must regulate this activity in relation to certain norms (normativity). We find that even minimal forms of proto-cellular systems can already provide a paradigmatic example of genuine agency. By abstracting away some specific details of minimal models of living agency we define the kind of organization that is capable of meeting the required conditions for agency (which is not restricted to living organisms). On this basis, we define agency as an autonomous organization that adaptively regulates its coupling with its environment and contributes to sustaining itself as a consequence. We find that spatiality and temporality are the two fundamental domains in which agency spans at different scales. We conclude by giving an outlook for the road that lies ahead in the pursuit of understanding, modeling, and synthesizing agents.",

EE uses a population of physical robots that autonomously reproduce with one another while situated in their task environment. This constitutes a fully distributed evolutionary algorithm embodied in physical robots. Several issues identified by researchers in the evolutionary robotics community as problematic for the development of ER are alleviated by the use of a large number of robots being evaluated in parallel. Particularly, EE avoids the pitfalls of the simulate-and-transfer method and allows the speed-up of evaluation time by utilizing parallelism. The more novel features of EE are that the evolutionary algorithm is entirely decentralized, which makes it inherently scalable to large numbers of robots, and that it uses many robots in a shared task environment, which makes it an interesting platform for future work in collective robotics and Artificial Life. We have built a population of eight robots and successfully implemented the first example of Embodied Evolution by designing a fully decentralized, asynchronous evolutionary algorithm. Controllers evolved by EE outperform a hand-designed controller in a simple application. We introduce our approach and its motivations, detail our implementation and initial results, and discuss the advantages and limitations of EE.",

@article{prieto10openendedevolutionasmeanstoselforganizeheterogeneousmultirobotsystemsrealtime,
	abstract = "This work deals with the application of multi-robot systems to real tasks and, in particular, their coordination through interaction based control systems. Within this field, the practical solutions that have been implemented in real robots mainly use strongly coordinated architectures and assignment strategies because of reliability and fault tolerance issues when addressing problems in reality. Emergent approaches have also been proposed with limited success, basically due to the unpredictability of the behaviors obtained. Here, an emergent approach, called r-ASiCo, is presented containing a procedure to produce predictable solutions and thus avoiding the typical problems associated with these techniques. The r-ASico algorithm is the real time version of the Asynchronous Situated Co-evolution algorithm (ASiCo), which exploits natural open-ended evolution to generate emergent complex collective behaviors and deals with systems made up of a huge number of elements and nonlinear interactions. The goal of r-ASiCo is to design the global behavior desired for the robot team as a collective entity and allow the emergence of behaviors through the interaction of the team members using social rules they learn to implement. To this end, r-ASiCo manages a series of features that are inherent to natural evolution based methods such as energy exchange and mating selection procedures, together with a technique to guide the evolution towards a design objective, the principled evaluation function selection procedure. Hence, this paper presents the components and operation of r-ASiCo and illustrates its application through a collective cleaning task example. It was implemented using 8 e-puck robots in two different real scenarios and its results complemented with those of a 30 e-puck case. The results show the capabilities of r-ASiCo to create a self-organized and adaptive multi-robot system configuration that is tolerant to environmental changes and to failures within the robot team.",

While numerous models have investigated the mechanisms allowing an efficient colony response to external changes in the environment and internal perturbations, little attention has been devoted to the genetic architecture underlying task specialisation. We used artificial evolution to compare the performances of three simple genetic architectures underlying within colony variation in response thresholds of workers to five tasks. In the "deterministic mapping" system, the thresholds of individuals for each of the five tasks is strictly genetically determined. In the second genetic architecture ("probabilistic mapping"), the genes only influence the probability of engaging in one of the tasks. Finally, in the "dynamic mapping" system, the propensity of workers to engage in one of the five tasks depends not only on their own genotype but also on the behavioural phenotypes of other colony members. We found that the deterministic mapping system performed well only when colonies consist of unrelated individuals and are not subjected to perturbations in task allocation. The probabilistic mapping system performed well for colonies of related and unrelated individuals when there were no perturbations. Finally, the dynamic mapping system performed well under all conditions and was much more efficient than the two other mapping systems when there were perturbations. Overall, our simulations reveal that the type of mapping between genotype and individual behaviour greatly influences the dynamics of task specialisation and colony productivity. Our simulations also reveal complex interactions between the mode of mapping, level of within colony relatedness and risk of colony perturbations.},

	abstract = "Evolutionary robotics (ER) aims at automatically designing robots or controllers of robots without having to describe their inner workings. To reach this goal, ER researchers primarily employ phenotypes that can lead to an infinite number of robot behaviors and fitness functions that only reward the achievement of the task-and not how to achieve it. These choices make ER particularly prone to premature convergence. To tackle this problem, several papers recently proposed to explicitly encourage the diversity of the robot behaviors, rather than the diversity of the genotypes as in classic evolutionary optimization. Such an approach avoids the need to compute distances between structures and the pitfalls of the noninjectivity of the phenotype/behavior relation; however, it also introduces new questions: how to compare behavior? should this comparison be task specific? and what is the best way to encourage diversity in this context? In this paper, we review the main published approaches to behavioral diversity and benchmark them in a common framework. We compare each approach on three different tasks and two different genotypes. The results show that fostering behavioral diversity substantially improves the evolutionary process in the investigated experiments, regardless of genotype or task. Among the benchmarked approaches, multi-objective methods were the most efficient and the generic, Hamming-based, behavioral distance was at least as efficient as task specific behavioral metrics.",

Secondly, it implies that they are somehow materialized inhabitants of the intersubjective field of human activity. Thirdly, it implies that models can function also as knowledge objects.

It is argued that simulations do not explain processes in the real world directly. The way in which simulations help explaining real‐world processes is conceived as indirect, mediated by the theoretical model.

	comment = {=== 1. The information analogy === * Where an engineer sees design, a biologist sees natural selection. * In information theory, Shannon's (1948) measure of quantity of information, Sum p log p, is a measure of the capacity of a channel to transmit information, given by the number of different messages that could have been sent. * There are difficulties in applying information theory in genetics. They arise principally, not in the transmission of information, but in its meaning. [...] "this word 'information' in communication theory relates not so much to what you do say, as to what you could say." (Shannon and Weaver) In biology, the question is, how does genetic information specify form and function? === 2. Weismann and the non-inheritance of acquired character === * Weismann recognized that heredity is concerned with the transmission of information, not just of matter or energy. * His ultimate reason for thinking that acquired characters are not inherited was that he could not conceive of a mechanism whereby it could happen. * I think that the non-inheritance of acquired characters is a contingent fact, usually but not always true, not a logical necessity. === 3. The genetic code === * The correspondence between a particular triplet and the amino-acid it codes for is arbitrary. === 4. Symbol and "gratuity" === * In molecular biology, inducers and repressors are "symbolic": in the terminology of semiotics, there is no necessary connection between their form (chemical composition) and meaning (genes switched on or off). === 5. The quantification of evolution === * The genome is not a description of the adult form, but a set of instructions on how to make it: it is a recipe, not a blueprint. === 6. Is the genome a developmental program? === * It is hard even to think about the problem if one does not think of genes sending signals, and if one does not recognize that the signals are symbolic. === 7. Evolution theory and the concept of information in biology === * Biologists draw a distinction between two types of causal chain, genetic and environmental, or 'nature' and 'nurture', for a number of reasons. Differences due to nature are likely to be inherited, whereas those due to nurture are not; evolutionary changes are changes in nature, not nurture; traits that adapt an organism to its environment are likely to be due to nature. * The distinction can be justified only if the concept of information is used in biology only for causes that have the property of intentionality. [...] This element of intentionality comes from natural selection. * Example of using genetic algorithm to program a computer. * Genomic information is 'meaningful' in that it generates an organism able to survive in the environment in which selection has acted. [...] Research in developmental biology is concerned with identifying regulatory genes, and with identifying the higher-level rules whose parameters the genes control. === 8. Conclusions === * The notion of information as it is used in biology implies intentionality. It is for this reason that we speak of genes carrying information during development, and of environmental fluctuations not doing so. * The activity of an enzyme depends on the laws of chemistry and on the chemical environment. There is no structure which can be thought of as an evolved "receiver"of a "message" from the enzyme. In contrast, the effect of a regulatory protein does depend on an evolved receiver of the information it carries. For these reasons, I want to say that genes and regulatory proteins carry information, but enzymes do not. * The genome is as it is because of millions of years of selection, favoring those genomes that cause the development of organisms able to survive in a given environment. As a result, the genome has the base sequence it does because it generates an adapted organism. It is in this sense that genomes have intentionality. * Intelligent design and natural selection produce similar results. One justification for this view is that programs designed by humans to produce a result are similar to, and may be indistinguishable from, programs generated by mindless selection. *********************************************************** Notes de Marie-Claude Lorne lors d'un s{\'e}minaire PhilBio {\`a} l'IHPST le 5 janvier 2006. === Introduction - Motivation d'une r{\'e}flexion sur l'information === - caract{\`e}re tr{\`e}s r{\'e}pandu du vocabulaire informationnel en biologie mol{\'e}culaire - ceci s'explique en partie par l'importance qu'ont eu les concepts informationnels dans la constitution de la biologie mol{\'e}culaire.

But the received view currently faces a competitor--a very different view of theories known as the "semantic" view. It is argued here that the semantic view is more sensitive to the nature and limitations of evolutionary theory than is the received view. In particular, the semantic view better accomodates the fact that evolutionary theory is bound to change as a result of the evolutionary process itself. This unusual feature of evolutionary theory provides a good reason for reconsidering the received view and paying close attention to the semantic view.},

@article{beatty1980ptimaldesignmodelsandstrategyofmodelbuildinginevolutionarybiology,
	abstract = {The prevalence of optimality models in the literature of evolutionary biology is testimony to their popularity and importance. Evolutionary biologist R. C. Lewontin, whose criticisms of optimality models are considered here, reflects that "optimality arguments have become extremely popular in the last fifteen years, and at present represent the dominant mode of thought." Although optimality models have received little attention in the philosophical literature, these models are very interesting from a philosophical point of view. As will be argued, optimality models are central to evolutionary thought, yet they are not readily accomodated by the traditional view of scientific theories. According to the traditional view, we would expect optimality models to employ general, empirical laws of nature, but they do not. Fortunately, the semantic view of scientific theories, a recent alternative to the traditional view, more readily accomodates optimality models. As we would expect on the semantic view, optimality models can be construed as specifications of ideal systems. These specifications may be used to describe empirical systems--that is, the specifications may have empirical instances. But the specifications are not empirical claims, much less general, empirical laws. Although philosophers have yet to discuss the general features and uses of optimality models, these topics have stimulated much recent discussion among evolutionary biologists. Their discussions raise a number of precautions concerning the proper use of optimality models. Moreover, many of their caveats can be interpreted as general reminders that 1) optimality models specify ideal systems whose empirical instantiations may be quite restricted, and that 2) optimality models should not be construed as general, empirical laws. As G. F. Oster and E. O. Wilson caution, "the prudent course is to regard optimality models as provisional guides to further empirical research and not necessarily as the key to deeper laws of nature." It seems, then, that the semantic view of theories is more sensitive to the nature and limitations of optimality models than is the more traditional view of theories.},

	abstract = "For several years now, various researchers have endeavored to apply artificial evolution to the automatic design of control systems for real robots. One of the major challenges they face concerns the question of how to assess the fitness of evolving controllers when each evolutionary run typically involves hundreds of thousands of such assessments. This article outlines new ways of thinking about and building simulations upon which such assessments can be performed. It puts forward sufficient conditions for the successful transfer of evolved controllers from simulation to reality and develops a potential methodology for building simulations in which evolving controllers are forced to satisfy these conditions if they are to be reliably fit. It is hypothesized that as long as simulations are built according to this methodology, it does not matter how inaccurate or incomplete they are: Controllers that have evolved to be reliably fit in simulation still will transfer into reality. Two sets of experiments are reported, both of which involve minimal look-up table-based simulations built according to these guidelines. In the first set, controllers were evolved that allowed a Khepera robot to perform a simple memory task in the real world. In the second set, controllers were evolved for the Sussex University gantry robot that were able to distinguish visually a triangle from a square, under extremely noisy real-world conditions, and to steer the robot toward the triangle. In both cases, controllers that were reliably fit in simulation displayed extremely robust behavior when downloaded into reality.",

This failure is unfortunate because there are important contrasts among the goals, procedures, and representations employed by modelers and other kinds of theorists. We can see some of these differences intuitively when we reflect on the methods of theorists such as Vito Volterra and Linus Pauling on the one hand, and Charles Darwin and Dimitri Mendeleev on the other. Much of Volterra's and Pauling's work involved modeling; much of Darwin's and Mendeleev's did not. In order to capture this distinction, I consider two examples of theory construction in detail: Volterra's treatment of post-WWI fishery dynamics and Mendeleev's construction of the periodic system. I argue that modeling can be distinguished from other forms of theorizing by the procedures modelers use to represent and to study real-world phenomena: indirect representation and analysis. This differentiation between modelers and non-modelers is one component of the larger project of understanding the practice of modeling, its distinctive features, and the strategies of abstraction and idealization it employs",

	abstract = "Evolutionary Robotics (ER) is a powerful approach for the automatic synthesis of robot controllers, as it requires little a priori knowledge about the problem to be solved in order to obtain good solutions. This is particularly true for collective and swarm robotics, in which the desired behaviour of the group is an indirect result of the control and communication rules followed by each individual. However, the experimenter must make several arbitrary choices in setting up the evolutionary process, in order to define the correct selective pressures that can lead to the desired results. In some cases, only a deep understanding of the obtained results can point to the critical aspects that constrain the system, which can be later modified in order to re-engineer the evolutionary process towards better solutions. In this paper, we discuss the problem of engineering the evolutionary machinery that can lead to the desired result in the swarm robotics context. We also present a case study about self-organising synchronisation in a swarm of robots, in which some arbitrarily chosen properties of the communication system hinder the scalability of the behaviour to large groups. We show that by modifying the communication system, artificial evolution can synthesise behaviours that properly scale with the group size.",

We apply a biologically inspired selection scheme, in which there is no explicit communication of the individuals{\rq} fitness information. The individuals can only reproduce offspring by mating---a pair-wise exchange of genotypes---and the probability that an individual reproduces offspring in its own subpopulation is dependent on the individual{\rq}s {\lq}{\lq}health,{\rq}{\rq} that is, energy level, at the mating occasion. We validate the proposed method by comparing it with evolution using standard centralized selection, in simulation, and by transferring the obtained solutions to hardware using two real robots.",

On this view, the gene is the only unit with sufficient stability to act as a unit of selection, with individuals and groups being more ephemeral units of function, but not of selection. This view is argued to be incorrect, on several grounds. The empirical and theoretical bases for the existence of higher-level units of selection are explored, and alternative analyses discussed critically. The success of a multi-level selection theory demands the recognition and development of a multi-level genetics. The way to accomplish this is suggested. The genotype/phenotype distinction also requires further analysis to see how it applies at higher levels of organization. This analysis provides a way of defining genotype and phenotype for cultural evolution, and a treatment of the innate-acquired distinction which are both generalizeable to analyze problems of the nature and focus of scientific change.},

This crucial notion of embodiment underlies fundamental changes in the field of artificial intelligence over the past two decades, and Pfeifer and Bongard use the basic methodology of artificial intelligence--"understanding by building"--to describe their insights. If we understand how to design and build intelligent systems, they reason, we will better understand intelligence in general. In accessible, nontechnical language, and using many examples, they introduce the basic concepts by building on recent developments in robotics, biology, neuroscience, and psychology to outline a possible theory of intelligence. They illustrate applications of such a theory in ubiquitous computing, business and management,and the psychology of human memory.

The book concludes by proposing a new minimalist interdisciplinary framework for the study of perception, combining simulation modeling, experimental methods and accounts of subjective experience. This book endorses an enactive and constructivist view on the human mind, in opposition to the traditional information-processing view. Furthermore, the book discusses and presents the enactive approach, clarifies the assets of this view and how it differs from other proposed alternatives to the computationalist paradigm in AI and Cognitive Science, crucial and missing in the ongoing embodied turn.

	abstract = "The roots of swarm intelligence are deeply embedded in the biological study of self-organized behaviors in social insects. From the routing of traffic in telecommunication networks to the design of control algorithms for groups of autonomous robots, the collective behaviors of these animals have inspired many of the foundational works in this emerging research field. For the first issue of this journal dedicated to swarm intelligence, we review the main biological principles that underlie the organization of insects{\rq} colonies. We begin with some reminders about the decentralized nature of such systems and we describe the underlying mechanisms of complex collective behaviors of social insects, from the concept of stigmergy to the theory of self-organization in biological systems. We emphasize in particular the role of interactions and the importance of bifurcations that appear in the collective output of the colony when some of the system{\rq}s parameters change. We then propose to categorize the collective behaviors displayed by insect colonies according to four functions that emerge at the level of the colony and that organize its global behavior. Finally, we address the role of modulations of individual behaviors by disturbances (either environmental or internal to the colony) in the overall flexibility of insect colonies. We conclude that future studies about self-organized biological behaviors should investigate such modulations to better understand how insect colonies adapt to uncertain worlds.",

@article{wilson1994reintroducinggroupselectiontothehumanbehavioralsciences,
	abstract = "ABSTRACT In both biology and the human sciences, social groups are sometimes treated as adaptive units whose organization cannot be reduced to individual interactions. This group-level view is opposed by a more individualistic one that treats social organization as a byproduct of self-interest. According to biologists, group-level adaptations can evolve only by a process of natural selection at the group level. Most biologists rejected group selection as an important evolutionary force during the 1960s and 1970s but a positive literature began to grow during the 1970s and is rapidly expanding today. We review this recent literature and its implications for human evolutionary biology. We show that the rejection of group selection was based on a misplaced emphasis on genes as ``replicators'' which is in fact irrelevant to the question of whether groups can be like individuals in their functional organization. The fundamental question is whether social groups and other higher-level entities can be ``vehicles'' of selection. When this elementary fact is recognized, group selection emerges as an important force in nature and what seem to be competing theories, such as kin selection and reciprocity, reappear as special cases of group selection. The result is a unified theory of natural selection that operates on a nested hierarchy of units.The vehicle-based theory makes it clear that group selection is an important force to consider in human evolution. Humans can facultatively span the full range from self-interested individuals to ``organs'' of group-level ``organisms.'' Human behavior not only reflects the balance between levels of selection but it can also alter the balance through the construction of social structures that have the effect of reducing fitness differences within groups, concentrating natural selection (and functional organization) at the group level. These social structures and the cognitive abilities that produce them allow group selection to be important even among large groups of unrelated individuals.",
