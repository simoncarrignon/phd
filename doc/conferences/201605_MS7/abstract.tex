Social Science, and History of social activity in particular, is a difficult task. It rely on few int and reliable source and most of the knowledge about the mechanisms at sake has to be infered from indirect data.
We think that computer simulation are a good way to overcome such problem.  After that we will show that the problem encountered by people studying evolutionary biology are close to those encountered by arcaheologist. We will show how evolutionary biologist have embrassed mathematical and computer model to overcome such problem and propose inference similare to those done verbaly by historians. We will then spend sometime why the use of computer model is a powerfull heuristic tool in life science in general and we will finish by soutenir that interdisciplinary project are the best suited framework to implement such approach.

Indeed, when studying evolutionary biology, people has to reconstruct the
