In fields where analitycal description of the system is hard , Agent Based Model is becoming a central tool to formalize and test hypothesis. This has led to more and more model with growing number of paramaters, that are hard to explore analitycaly and sometimes be hard to relate to empirical evidence. Approximate Bayesian Computation allows to solve those issue by allowing tthe use of the bayesian framework with any kind of modelfevene if the posterior distribution cannot be estimated easily. But this methods come with a high computational coast. The computational coast can quickly became a problem when that Agent based model is involving a important number of agents having interdepdnant interaction.
We present here an example  from archaeology. In archaeology not only the formulation of hypothesis is seldomly formally implemented, but the available data to test those hypothesis is biased noisy and incomplete.
