	abstract = {This paper presents a critique of expected utility theory as a descriptive model of decision making under risk, and develops an alternative model, called prospect theory. Choices among risky prospects exhibit several pervasive effects that are inconsistent with the basic tenets of utility theory. In particular, people underweight outcomes that are merely probable in comparison with outcomes that are obtained with certainty. This tendency, called the certainty effect, contributes to risk aversion in choices involving sure gains and to risk seeking in choices involving sure losses. In addition, people generally discard components that are shared by all prospects under consideration. This tendency, called the isolation effect, leads to inconsistent preferences when the same choice is presented in different forms. An alternative theory of choice is developed, in which value is assigned to gains and losses rather than to final assets and in which probabilities are replaced by decision weights. The value function is normally concave for gains, commonly convex for losses, and is generally steeper for losses than for gains. Decision weights are generally lower than the corresponding probabilities, except in the range of low probabilities. Overweighting of low probabilities may contribute to the attractiveness of both insurance and gambling.},

Disposition effects can be explained by the two features of prospect theory: the idea that people value gains and losses relative to a reference point (the initial purchase price of shares), and the tendency to seek risk when faced with possible losses, and avoid risk when a certain gain is possible. Our experiments were designed to see if subjects would exhibit disposition effects. Subjects bought and sold shares in six risky assets. Asset prices fluctuated in each period. Contrary to Bayesian optimization, subjects did tend to sell winners and keep losers. When the shares were automatically sold after each period, the disposition effect was greatly reduced.},
