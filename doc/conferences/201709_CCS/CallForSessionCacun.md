#Evolution of Cultural Complexity

September 21, 2017 (8:30-17:00)
Cancun, Mexico 

##Scope of the Satellite
The production and the development of *cultural artifacts* has been documented throughout the story of Humanity. The nature of such production range from tools as simple as rock used to break nuts, to complex multilevel social organisation and spaceship able to land man on other planets. 
If it's admitted that this *complexity* tends to increase in time, cases of decrease and lost have also been reported. Moreover, the condition and the factors drivings this increase are still hardly known and subject to debate. Different hypothesis have been proposed (demographic factor, cognitive component, historical contingency...) but so far no consensus has been reached.

Among others, it raises a certain number of questions:

1. What are the main factors allowing an increase of cultural complexity?  

2. What are the reliable way to measure the complexity of cultural artifacts?

3. How can we quantify and compare the impact of different factors? 

4. What tools and methods can we use?

5. ...


###Goals
To push forward our understanding of this problem we want, during this satellite, to bring together a community made of different scientific domains interested in different aspect of the evolution of social and cultural artifacts.
We want to to promote and consolidate a rich, depth dialogue on this question from different perspectives: theoretical as well as empirical approaches, based on historical and archaeological sources, as well as actual evidences and contemporary theories. We believe it to be an important step towards a solid and cohesive framework for the understanding of cultural evolution in general and for the problem at sake in particular. Our approach is supported by a pattern of convergence between simulation and formal methods in archaeological studies and recent developments in complex systems and complex networks. 

The following topics will receive particular attention:

- Social dynamics of innovation.

- Cumulative Culture.

- Evolution of Technology.

- Cognitive Process of Creativity and Innovation . 

- Population Dynamics and Demographic Studies.



###Tentative Program

The topic of the satellite is very timely and of high interest to a wide and diverse group of researcher in complex systems. 
We believe the best format to successfully push forward the discussion is a one day satellite that allows considerable time for  exposing all the relevant point of views and promote further discussion.
Thus we propose a satellite with 8 presentations, 4 on the morning and 4 on the evening. Half of the talk will be 45min presentation+question made by the Invited Speakers, the other half will be 30min presentation+question on the submitted abstract.

We propose to end the day be a 1:30 panel discussion.


###Attendance

Including the 4 invited speakers, the 4 accepted speakers and the 4 organizers, we expect between 30 to 50 persons.
