#CCS'17: The Conference on Complex Systems 2017

Cancun, Mexico. September 17-22.

http://ccs17.unam.mx
 

The flagship conference of the Complex Systems Society will go to Latin America for the first time in 2017. The Mexican complex systems community is enthusiast to welcome colleagues to one of our richest destinations: Cancun.
 

As usual with the Conferences on Complex Systems, apart from the main tracks of the conference, there will be two full days of satellites (Wednesday, September 20th and Thursday, September 21st). We therefore call for satellite proposals for half a day or full day events. Satellite organizers are responsible for promoting, organizing, reviewing, and scheduling their session.
 

Scientifically sound proposals should be less than 1000 words, including scope of the satellite, goals, tentative program (format, half-day/full day, invited speakers), estimated attendance, and organizers.
 

Proposals should be submitted in PDF format to satellites@ccs17.unam.mx
 

Important Dates:
 
   - Satellite proposals deadline    February 17th

   - Satellite decisions sent    March 10th

   - Satellite program details    August 4th

#Evolution of Cultural Complexity

September 21, 2017 (8:30-17:00)
Cancun, Mexico 

##Scope of the Satellite
Throughtout the story of the Humanity, cultural artifacts have been documented to range from tools as simple as a rock used to break nuts to complex multilevel social organisation and spaceshift made of numerous and hilghy specialised part able to bring land man to other palnet. 
Nonetheless, the condition and the drivers of such changes in complexity  are still hardly known. Differents hypothesis have been propose (demographic, cognitive, historical) but no consensus seems to emerge.

Cognitive constraint
Demographic factors
Transmission strategies
Cumulative culture


###Goals
In order to answer the questions raised the goal of this satellite is  to bring together a community coming from different scientific domains interested in understanding the different aspect of the evolution of social and cultural artifacts.
We want to to promote and consolidate a rich, depth dialogue about this problem from different perspectives, theoretical as well as emprical, using historical archeological as well as actual sources and evidence. We believe this an important step towards a solid cohesive framework for cultural evolution. Our approach is supported by a pattern of convergence between simulation and formal methods in archaeological studies and recent developments in complex systems and complex networks. The following topics will receive particular attention:

1. What are the main driver of cultural complexity?  

2. What are the realiable way to measure complexity of cultural artifact?

3. How can we compare different aspect? 

3. What tools and methods can be applied to measure co


To adress those question the focus will be made on:

- Social dynamics of innovation.

- Cumulative Culture.

- Cognitive Process of Creativity and Innovation . 

- Population Dynamics Demographic Studies.




###Tentative Program

Knowing the controversial nature of the topic and the lack of consensus on thoses questions, we think (and know by experience?) that the best format to successfully push forward the discussion is a one day satellite with time for discussion.  

We propose a day with 8 presentation, 4 on the morning and 4 on the evening. Half of the talk will be 45min presentation+question made by the Invited Speakers, the other half will be 30min presentation+question on the submitted abstract.

We propose to end the day be a 1:30 panel discussion.


###Attendance

Including the 4 invited speakers, the 4 accepted speakers and the 4 organizers, we expect between 30 to 50 persons.

#The Cultural Evolution of Technology

    EVOTECH 2015

September 30th, 2015 (8:30-17:00)
Tempe, Arizona
Coronado Room Conference Center

#evotech15

The evolution of technology is a human-driven parallel experiment of evolution. Although artifacts are not yet capable of self-reproduction, the process of technological change resembles a process of descent with variation and selection. The parallelisms between culture and evolution suggests the existence of common mechanisms and also important differences. Natural innovations are largely the outcome of tinkering and only the elimination of whole branches of the tree of life can restart natural complexity. Technological developments can, in principle, reset this ‘complexity clock’ by introducing new devices from scratch, but the history of technology also shows the relevance of recombination and contingency. The lack of solid measures and definitions is a serious obstacle that requires the integration of theoretical and empirical approaches within an unified framework. We will address the following key challenges: 

1. What are the similarities and differences between natural and artificial evolution? 

2. Does technology evolve within the same framework than other cultural traits?

3. What tools and methods can be applied to model cultural evolution?

4. How can we detect evolutionary processes in datasets?


###Programs

8:30-8:45 Opening Remarks & Introduction

8:45-9:30 Robert Boyd - (TBA)

9:30-10:15 David Krakauer -  (TBA)

###Call for Contributions

In this satellite meeting we will bring together a community coming from different scientific domains interested in understanding the relationship between natural and artificial evolution. The goal is to promote a rich, depth dialogue about this problem from different perspectives. We believe this an important step towards a solid theoretical framework for cultural evolution. Our approach is supported by a pattern of convergence between simulation and formal methods in archaeological studies and recent developments in complex systems and complex networks. The following topics will receive particular attention:

- Phylogenetic approach to cultural evolution.

- Social dynamics of innovation.

- Technological transitions.

- Creativity and innovation in technological evolution. 

- Language evolution.

- Patent and scientific citation analysis.

- Evolution and dynamics of cultural systems. 


###Submission

Submissions will be made by sending one A4 page abstract in PDF via Easychair.

The deadline for abstract submssion is 22 June 2015 30 June 2015.

The contributions to this satellite will be evaluated by the scientific committee through a peer review process that will evaluate the scientific quality and the relevance to the goal of this workshop.

Notifications of accepted abstracts will be communicated by end of July 2015.


Registration

ALL the speakers and participants of this satellite have to register for CCS'15 here (early registration feeds applied up to June 30th).
