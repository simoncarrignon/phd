#Evolution of Cultural Complexity

September 21, 2017 (8:30-17:00)
Cancun, Mexico

##Scope of the Satellite
It has been documented the production and the development of cultural artifacts throughout the story of the Humanity. The nature of such production range from tools as       simple as rock used to break nuts, to complex multilevel social organisation and spaceship able to land man on other planets.
If it's admitted that this complexity seems to increase in time, case of decrease and lost have also been reported. Moreover, the condition and the factors drivings this     increase of complexity  are still hardly known. Different hypothesis have been propose (demographic factor, cognitive component, historical contingency...) but so far no     consensus has been reached.

Among other, this observation raise a certain number of question:

1. What are the main factor allowing an increase of cultural complexity?

2. What are the reliable way to measure complexity of cultural artifact?

3. How can we compare the impact of different factors?

3. What tools and methods can be applied to measure answer those questions?




###Goals
To push forward our understanding of this questions we want, through this satellite, to bring together a community made from different scientific domains and interested in   the different aspect of the evolution of social and cultural artifacts.
We want to to promote and consolidate a rich, depth dialogue about this question from different perspectives: theoretical as well as empirical approaches, based on           historical and archaeological sources, as well as actual evidences and contemporary theories. We believe it to be an important step towards a solid and cohesive framework    for the understanding of cultural evolution in general and for the problem at sake in particular. Our approach is supported by a pattern of convergence between simulation    and formal methods in archaeological studies and recent developments in complex systems and complex networks.

The following topics will receive particular attention:

- Social dynamics of innovation.

- Cumulative Culture.

- Cognitive Process of Creativity and Innovation .

- Population Dynamics Demographic Studies.
