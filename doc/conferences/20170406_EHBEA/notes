Cultural Atractor Theory
sceintific causal theory to explain cultural phenomenon
analogy with epidemiology
Kirby 2017
sperber and hirshfeld 2007 => cognitive causal chain

publi vs internal processes


transmission is a matter of re-production, not replication

factor of attraction: psychological/Ecological // global vs local (ex global ecological=> meaning of day, global psychologicla=> state)
CAT vs DIT
cat is evolutionary because it is populational evol. is important to bring..shit i misset it but its point of contact with other approach
end goal=>   explain human adaptation? vsc explin cultura (sperber) vs richerson "adaptation to local environments in time and space what cultural evolution is all about"
what culture is
s sen

common agenda=> evol to de couple mechanisms of transmission and forces of changes but CAT says is impossibls sene


reproduction of toke with or without representation
