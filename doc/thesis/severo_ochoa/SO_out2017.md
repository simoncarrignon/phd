Severa Ochoa BSC 
================

Cultural evolutionary studies, as proposed by Prof. Alex Mesoudi and other, brings together experimental and fields studies (as biology, anthropology, archaeology, psychology,...) with mathematical and computer modeling to understand socio-cultural changes in human societies.  

In parallel and decades ago, biologists have observed that size of organisms is correlated with various physiological measurements, unveiling large scale evolutionary dynamic. Since, similar relationships have been shown between a wide range of socio-economical indicators (unemployment rates, innovation, energetic efficiency,...) and the size of cities, suggesting similar large scale evolutionary dynamics in cultural process.

To understand the origin of it, we propose to combine the cultural evolution framework and the experimental expertise of the HBCE group with knowledge from the BSC to study:
How learning behaviours and economic activity have shaped the scaling properties of cities and urban centers throughout the history of Humanity?

This will push forward and strengthen efforts done by the EPNet team of the CASE department to bring HPC solutions and machine learning techniques to Social Sciences and Humanities. We expect those methods to solve numerous problems that researchers are facing when trying to understand the evolution of socio-economics and historic phenomena (noisy and heterogeneous data, biased and incomplete historical sources,...).

On top of the scientific knowledge produced, this project will:
	Build a new partnership between the BSC and a young and leading research group publishing in the highest scientific journals (Proc. B, PNAS, Nature,...), in one of the 10 best universities in the UK,
	Develop a unique methodology coupling HPC to social sciences and urban simulation studies; thus positioning the BSC has a leader in the emerging and quickly growing fields of Cultural Evolution and Computational Social Sciences.

=============

Scaling properties are one of most striking regularities found in Nature. It has been decades then, that biologists have observed that the size of organisms is correlated with the rate of their metabolism, their speed and other physiological measurement.  Similar regularities have been shown in a wide range of socio-economical measures, i.e., the communication speed inside the cities, unemployment rates, innovation, energetic efficiency and so on, scales with the size of cities. We propose to study the origin of scaling properties in socio-economic systems using a cultural evolution approach. How learning behaviour has shaped these remarkable regularities in cities and urban centers throughout the history of Humanity? Cultural evolution - as proposed by lead figures like Prof. Alex Mesoudi (University of Exeter) and others - provides the right framework to address these questions. A challenge is to detect these regularites in highly-heterogeneous, historical data sources. We believe that machine learning and supercomputing can help solving this problem. This collaborative project has two main goals: (1) to  reinforce the applications of high-performance computing in social sciences and urban simulation and (2) to increase the visibility of the BSC and Severo Ochoa research project in the international scientific communities and in the emerging research field of cultural evolution and computational social sciences.
