Alex Bentley is a Professor and Chair of Anthropology at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. His research has explored cultural change in different environments, from prehistoric societies to contemporary communities. He just published a new book with Michael O’Brien on the topic :

“The Acceleration of Cultural Change: From Ancestors to Algorithms” (M.I.T. Press, forthcoming 2017)

Professor Bentley is one of the first researcher that introduced computer simulations as a central tool to study cultural changes, and is a leading figure in the field of Cultural Evolution.

In the Computational Social Science group at the BSC, we have refined and complexified some of the original models described by Pr. Bentley, in order to incorporate economic knowledge and allow the use of such model on HPC facilities.  We are also developing new set of tools based on Bayesian statistics to interpret the results of those models in a more accurate and meaningful way.

We first met the professor during a Satellite Session organized by the BSC's team in Cancún, where we invited him to give a keynote talk. At this occasion we presented him the work done at the BSC and ideas of possible joint collaborations  were already discussed. This stay at the University of Tennessee would be the perfect occasion to materialize those ideas and start working on the well known case study of professor Bentley but using the framework developed here at the Barcelona Supercomputer Center.

On top of the scientific knowledge produced, this project will:
        Build a new partnership between the BSC and one of the leader of the emerging field of Cultural Evolution
        Publish re-intepretration of well known studies using the tools already developped at the BSC
