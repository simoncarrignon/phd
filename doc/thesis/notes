think about an overall picture for thesis 


Although mathematicians, physicists, and engineers were essential, the best of the groups also contained physiologists, biochemists, psychologists, and a variety of
representatives of other fields of the biochemical and social sciences.  [..] It was found, in spite of the modern tendencies toward intense scientific specialization, that members of such diverse groups could work together and could form a unit which was much greater than the mere sum of its parts. It was shown that these groups could tackle certain problems of organized complexity, and get useful answers.

It is tempting to forecast that the great advances that science can and must achieve in the next fifty years will be largely contributed to by voluntary mixed teams, [...] their activities made effective by the use of large, flexible, and highspeed computing machines.

Cultural Evolution and Social Learning theory have now to prove to people outside of the field that it's a solid framework that can be applied to understand a wide range of phenomena.  It should help to make easy to solve problems that are not easy to solve even having archaeological data.  is approached from a different point of view. It should create logical link between wide range of phenomena that were not considered to be linked.
In other words, the same way Darwin made obvious that a paleontologist, a Marine biologist and an embryologist were working on the same thing, Cultural Evolution and Social learning should made obvious that an ethologist working on the bumblebee learning abilities, an archaeologist studying the development of pottery making techniques and a computer scientist developing an algorithm to follow the spread of flue through online social media are also working on the same thing.
