Severa Ochoa BSC 
================

Decades ago, biologists have observed that size of organisms is correlated with various physiological measurements. Since, similar relationship have been found between a wide range of socio-economical indicators (unemployment rates, innovation, energetic efficiency,...) and the size of the cities.  

To understand the origin of those properties, the "Cultural Evolution" approach - as proposed by lead figures like Prof. Alex Mesoudi from the Human Biolgoical and Cultural Evolution Group of the University of Exeter, UK - brings together experimental and fields studies (from biology to anthropology, archaeology and  psychology) with mathematical and computer modeling. 

This project will combine the experimental expertise of the HBCE group with tools and knowledge from the BSC to study:
> **How learning behaviours and economic activity have shaped the scaling properties of cities and urban centers throughout the history of Humanity?**

This will continue and strengthen efforts done by the EPNet team of CASE department of the BSC to bring HPC solutions and machine learning tools to Social Sciences and Humanities. We expect those tools to solve numerous problems that researchers are facing when trying to understand the evolution of socio-economics and historic phenomena (noisy and heterogeneous data, biased and incomplete historical sources,...).

On top of the scientific knowledge produced, this project will:
* Create a new partnership between the BSC and a leading research groups publishing in the highest scientific journals (Proc. B, PNAS, Nature,...) in one of the 10 best university in the UK,
* Develop a unique methodology coupling HPC to social sciences and urban simulation studies; thus positioning the BSC has a leader in the emerging and quickly growing fields of Cultural Evolution and Computational Social Sciences.  


Cost for 3 month project:
	Travel: 400€ 
	Monthly expenditure: 100€(transport)+800€(room)+200€(food )

Total: 	400€+3x1100€ = 3700€

Date: From May to July 2017

=============

Scaling properties are one of most striking regularities found in Nature. It has been decades then, that biologists have observed that the size of organisms is correlated with the rate of their metabolism, their speed and other physiological measurement.  Similar regularities have been shown in a wide range of socio-economical measures, i.e., the communication speed inside the cities, unemployment rates, innovation, energetic efficiency and so on, scales with the size of cities. We propose to study the origin of scaling properties in socio-economic systems using a cultural evolution approach. How learning behaviour has shaped these remarkable regularities in cities and urban centers throughout the history of Humanity? Cultural evolution - as proposed by lead figures like Prof. Alex Mesoudi (University of Exeter) and others - provides the right framework to address these questions. A challenge is to detect these regularites in highly-heterogeneous, historical data sources. We believe that machine learning and supercomputing can help solving this problem. This collaborative project has two main goals: (1) to  reinforce the applications of high-performance computing in social sciences and urban simulation and (2) to increase the visibility of the BSC and Severo Ochoa research project in the international scientific communities and in the emerging research field of cultural evolution and computational social sciences.
