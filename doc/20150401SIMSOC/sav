\section{Introduction}
In this article our aim is to present a model suitable to test various hyopthesis on economic and cultural exchange networks during the Roman Empire.
\section{General Description} 
\begin{itemize}
	\item  Agents :\\
		M agents with properties:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Price $(p_1,\cdots,p_n)$ : a particular goods that can be exchange against over good but not consumed.
			\item Quantity $(q_1,\cdots,q_n)$ : the quantity of each food owned by each agent.
			\item Subjective utility $(u_1,\cdots,u_n)$ : the values that each agent associates with each resource.
			\item Need $(b_1, \cdots, b_n)$ :  the quantity of each resource that each agent need to ``survive''. In the first time it only says the amount of resource that the agent will consume. It can be seen as the ``intrinsic'' value of the good ( which the same for every one at every time in Gintis 2006).
		\end{itemize}
	\item Resources :\\
		There is $n$ kind of resources, each one is produced by one or more Agents. Agents can exchange those resources and consume it following their need (cf. section Good prod\ldots)
\end{itemize}
\section{Good production}


Anyway we will use the \cite{gintis2006theemergenceofapricesystemfromdecentralizedbilateralexchange} in order to validate the model usability to implement such studies. In this model (Gingis 2006), at each simulation step, the agents produce $n$ unit of its resource .

Need references for : 
	The way resources are produced. Resource on Roman Industries? specialists vs generalist \cite{bentley2005specialisationandwealthinequalityinamodelofaclusteredeconomicnetwork}.

\section{Good Consumption}
and ``consume'The way resources are ``consumed'', link with the consumption of cultural good such as theater tickets (Levy-Garboua \& Momtmarquette 1996), studies on Roman cultural habits? In Gintis 2006 all the goods are consumed in the same proportion by all the agents, during all the simulation. What if those n:' a fixed-for-everyone proportion $b_1,\cdots,b_n$ of each resource $(1, \cdots, n)$

\section{Belief, Utility and cultural evolution}
In our model the ``cultural change'' is seen as the variation during time of the space of belief of all the agents. Pragmatically it's represented by variation in distribution of subjective utility vector.

This subjective utility is the value that agents ``put'' on each resources. It could be learn using any mechanism of ``social learning'' (as defined by \cite{lycett2015}) known in the literature (teaching, different kind of copying mechanisms,\ldots) and/or integrate any cognitive/environmental bias that could be studied (see again \cite{lycett2015} for some kind of bias that could be implemented). In the first experiment we will try simple random copying and frequency-dependent copying as \cite{mesoudi2009randomcopyingfrequencydependencopyingandulturechange} to show the usefulness of the method to study cultural change. 


\section{Economical Issues}

Using the network, the agents are able to barter/trade/exchange resources altogether. Here again, the idea is to propose a model in which several different bargaining/trading mechanisms can be tested. 


To begin we will implement a bargain mechanism already implemented in an Agent Based Model which is the one done by \cite{gintis2006theemergenceofapricesystemfromdecentralizedbilateralexchange} in order to be quickly able to compare our results and validate ability of the model to recreate economical behaviors. Later it could be used to study other model such as those developed by \cite{rubinstein1985equilibriuminamarketwithsequentialbargaining} and to test more general proposal, as those done by \cite{polanyi1957tradeandmarketintheearlyempireseconomiesinhistoryandtheory,polanyi1977thelivelihoodofman} about the early economical mechanisms.

In the Ginti's model the agent met all the producer of all goods and choose to exchange a certain amount of the good it produce with a certain amount of the needed value depending on their own stock and the value they assign respectively to the resource it produce and the resources needed. 

In order to be more realistic, and consistently with the cognitive and agent based approach of the project, we will also test assumption made by people from \emph{Prospect Theory} as proposed by \cite{kahneman1979prospecttheoryananalysisofdecisionunderrisk}, see also \cite{camerer2004prospecttheoryinthewildevidencefromthefield}, which focus to understand the impact of the human cognitive abilities on economics issues, such as the propensity of human to avoid ``risks'' when dealing with economics goods, even at some coast for its personal rewarding.
