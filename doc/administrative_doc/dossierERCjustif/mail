Una cosa a tener en cuenta creo es que todas mis contribucion estan a dentro del workpackage 3 en la propoiscion de la ERC:
 Lo pongo aqui :


--------------------
WP3: Modelling and Simulation
WP3 will focus on the development of an Agent-Based Model starting initially from
hypotheses and social processes generated from previous available research. This
technique will be used as the main simulation tool due to its capabilities to integrate
spatial information and behavioural constraints. WP3 is divided in two different phases.
First of all we will design a collection of abstract models created to explore particular
behaviours and situations. These models will be used to understand direct interactions
and relationships between the properties detected in the trade network at different
scales. Secondly, the knowledge generated by these experiments will be used to create a
new large-scale model. It will be particularly useful explore the potential changes that
specific historical events (i.e. political, military, etc.) could had on the structure of the
Roman trade network.
CEIPAC and BSC will be responsible of this WP. SIRIS will also participate in order to
support the methodological guidelines definition and operate as interface between the
natural and formal languages as in the WP1.

No se exactamente como hacertelo, te pongo todo allí y en ingles, dime si te va bien:


1 - CAA 2016: THE 44TH COMPUTER APPLICATIONS AND QUANTITUVE METHODS IN  ARCHAEOLOGY CONFERENCE - OSLO, MARCH 29 TO APRIL 2, 2016.
	- Work Done: Presentation of a newer version of the model developped previously and integration of work done with other collaborators of the EPNET project (team from PhysComp2 now Complex Lab Barcelona) 
	- Justification: The Computer Applications and Quantitative Methods in  Archaeology Conference (CAA) is the only conference in Archaeology that brings together Computer Science and Archaeology. It is of central importance for us to present our work there conference as it is a unique opportunity to share and exchange with international experts that master the both side of the EPNET projet.

2 - CAA CONCESSIONARY RATE MEMBERSHIP 2016: This is mandatory to participate to the CAA 

3 - COMPLENET 7TH WORKSHOP ON COMPLEX NETWORKS - DIJON, MARCH 23-25, 2016.
	- Work done: poster presentation of a ongoing work between two teams from the EPNET to bring together the agent based model built by the BSC team with network theory and analysis done in the UB team.
	- Title: "Influence of the topology of cultural networks on the equilibrium of an exchange-based economy"
	- Justification: Complenet is an important conference grouping people working on the application of networks theories to understand complex systems. Our participation to this conference is important as it allows us to see that the work we are doing mixing simulation and network theories inside the EPNET is not only original because we apply it to historical questions, but it is also at the state of the art within the community of network theory and complex system.

4 - 2016 COMPLEX SYSTEMS SUMMER SCHOOL - SANTA FE, FROM JUNE 12 TO JULY 8,  2016.
	- Work done: 1 month of lectures on complex system tools and starting of three international collaborations. Two of them led to papers that are going to be published in the following months: a) on Trieste Port Commercial exchange and b) on the evolution of symbiosis in Lichens (more info on those papers in section 5).
	- Justification: this is the most prestigious summer school in complex system. It allows students to learn the most advanced technics developed to analysis Complex Systems, from physics to economy, biology and social sciences. It promotes the development of scientific collaborations between students and allow the creations of international scientific network. Both side of the school (the learning part and the collaborative part) were of great benefit for the EPNET project and have been already presented, discussed and used within the project (see the document 3_CSSSchool2016PresentationEPNET.pdf for one presentation that have been to all the EPNET members).
 
5 - THE CONFERENCE ON COMPLEX SYSTEMS 2016 - AMSTERDAM, 19-22 SEPTEMBER 2016.
 	- Work done: Presentation in two differents Satellite Sessions of two ongoing papers started in the Santa Fe School.
	- Titles :  a) "Patterns In Globalization – Viewed through the lens of Trieste"
          	    b) "Modeling the Coevolutionary Dynamics in the Lobaria pulmonaria Lichen Symbiosis"

	- Justification: The conference on complex systems is the biggest conference  in the Complex System community. The presentation a) was about an ongoing international collaboration (with people from US, UK, Italy,Spain, Singapore and Holland) started during the Santa Fe summer school. This collaboration brings together techniques from complex systems theories in order to explore a new and unpublished dataset on the trade in the port of Trieste between 1850 and 1910. This works will help to quantify and understand the globalisation of the trade network and the economy during the industrial revolution and before the World War I. The clarity and the uniqueness of the  dataset make its the perfect occasion to test and validate the tools and models developed within the EPNET project. A first part of the work will be published during the following month and we are still working on a second part that focus more on validate and showing that the tools developed within EPNET are well suited to study  and understand economic process in past societies.  The presentation b) was about another similar collaboration started during the Santa Fe school, with researchers from Univ. Pompeu Fabra(Spain) and Panama. It is less obviously connected to the EPNET project as it is not about historical questions, but it involve the development of simulation to study cooperation and exchange interaction between evolving agents. In that sense, it's a work that push forward the development of project that aim to simulation and model decentralised system different entities interact and evolve together.

6- WSC 2015: WINTER SIMULATION CONFERENCE - HUNTINGTON BEACH, CA,  DECEMBER 6-9, 2015.

	- Work done: Presentation and proceedings
	- Title :  "Carrignon, S., Montanier, J.-M., & Rubio-Campillo, X. (2015). Modelling the Co-evolution of Trade and Culture in Past Societies". Online paper:http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7408550/ 
	- Justification: Presentation of the first version of the model that aims to answer the WP3, in one of the biggest conference on Simulation in the World (ranked B in most of the conference listing :http://lipn.univ-paris13.fr/~bennani/CSRank.html). Again, our participation to this conference is important as it shows that the work done within EPNET is not only highly innovative for of his deeply transcidiplinary nature, but also relevant and update within each discipline that it involves.



Supongo que los archivos que te enviamos no van a ser publico? pregunto por que los dos "draft_paper" (4_CSSSchool2016draft_paperA.pdf y 4_CSSSchool2016draft_paperB.pdf) estan por publicarse y entonces no se si se pueden compartir...
Simé si esto te va bien o si hay que cambiar algunas cosas!

Hasta luego,

Simon
