Dear Pr Sebastian, 

I write you as a PhD student enrolled in the biomedicine program of the UPF PhD School and following the advice of David Coma. This year I am helping the organization of JIPI, the "Jornada d'Investigadors Predoctorals Interdisciplin√†ria" (www.ub.edu/jipi/index.html), which will be held in February 2016. 

This event (which will be the 4th edition this year) aims to connect altogether postgraduate students from all Catalunya by allowing them to present their work during "flash talk" and by giving them presentations and general discussions about what is a PhD : how to go through it, what to do after, and so on. 

Previous years 50 students presented their work and almost 100 people had assisted to the conferences. Speakers and audience came from many different university and research center of Barcelona and Catalunya but, as far as I know, no one from UPF. 

I think it could be good if UPF was involved in that project, and I am pretty sure that lot of PhD students  would be interested to present something (I personally will, as I think it's a good training and a good way to meet people). 

We are looking for financial and/or logistical help, and I was thinking that maybe the UPF doctorate and/or the its different programs could help us.

If you need more information it would be a pleasure to answer to you questions and I am fully available to meet you during the following day if you want to discuss this project more in details.

Thank you for taking the time to read me,

All the best,

Simon Carrignon
