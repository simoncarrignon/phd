	history is easier to test than physical theory
	no science without empiracl test
	in principle string theory is testable
	in history it's easy
					
prediciton is a step of scientific explenation and hypothesis testing.
prediction in science is not about the future,

detect cycle and test into other region and see if it happen

Pigglucini : difference between detect pattern and speak about causal effect

turchin vs malthus
elite reproduction division of slice and vacante state
