Gene->cell->circuit->system->behavior

Schizophrenia exemple.22q11 microdeletion.
Genetic prob associated with different phenotypes desease

Mouse model with artificial micro deletion. Tested with T-maze, (delayed non match to sample test. Spatial task to test working memory

Muted mouse doesn't succed in the task.

So the two extreme of the scale. The gene (microdeletion) to behav (t.maze task).

Hypocampus with prefrontal cortex. Both are altered , interaction between both are altered.
Syncor or asyncro local field potential (LFP) as EEG but deep in brain. In the hypocampus. Single spike in the prefrontal.
Statistically phase between prefrontal spikes and hippocampus phase.

In muted mice?:
Phase locking.? Computer move.. I don't get it.b
Hipocmpus send info to PFC.

The dedixite in synchronization can predict the time of learning in muted mice.

How arise the synchronization and why desynchronization appears?

No projection between dorsal hypocampus and PFC so need pass through the ventral. Truc pompe qui inhibite avec des fibre optique.
Allow to remove the direct connexion between ventral hippo to PFC. (Spellman et. Al nature 2015)
But pb with the setup.
So more complex task
Record of neurones to see if PFC encode the goal
Using max margin linear classifier. To try to see if the firing rate record can help to classifier where is the mice.

The link between pfx and hippocampus is used only to record the goal. So partial explanation at the circuit level.

(note sur le carnet normal)
As pointed out by Herbert Simon more than 50 years ago, understanding human judgment requires examining both how the mind processes information and the structure of the information provided by their environment. Much psychological research focuses on the information processing component of Simon’s proposition. In this talk, I will review research that advances an alternative perspective which emphasizes the structure of the environment. 

The key mechanism is that the social environment exposes people to activities and objects they might otherwise have avoided: people get exposed to the activities their friends engage in, that their bosses instruct them to do, etc. By shaping the information samples to which people have access, the social structure has systematic effects on belief formation. As I will demonstrate, this approach offers alternative explanations, with distinct empirical predictions, for a wide range of belief and attitude patterns, including in-group bias, cynicism, preference for popular and novel items, and belief homogeneity within social groups.

\section{ABSTRACT: Intelectual Disability }
\begin{itemize}
    \item Seminar Title: Rembrandt: Remodelling brain development in intellectual disability 
    \item Speaker: Mara Dierssen
    \item Date: 20/04/2016
    \item Abstract: Down syndrome (DS) is the most common genetic form of intellectual disability, with an estimated incidence of more than 200,000 cases per year worldwide. In DS brain, suboptimal network architecture and altered synaptic communication arising from neurodevelopmental impairment are key determinants of cognitive defects. Regardless of their molecular cause, most DSs are characterized by neural plasticity disruption, and therefore this is a natural target for therapeutic purposes. Our group has demonstrated that epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the most abundant catechin of green tea, promotes learning and memory recovery, produces extensive dendritic remodeling in DS mouse models and significantly improves memory, executive functions and adaptive behavior along with increased functional connectivity in specific brain regions of DS adults (Phase I and Phase II clinical trials). This has been a crucial step in treating intellectual disability that has opened new important questions.

Less inhibitory content so wrong hypotheses? So should come from something else.
At the network level.using a mathematical model about conductivity
The model show that by less inhibitory is sufficient to reduce gamma stouf. Tough work.
Now we know how to recreate back the phenotypes.

Plasticity can change the connection.plasticity to avoid decline. Environment to restore the phenotypes.
Find a molecule to regulating the missing function. Egcg. Test on mouse.
