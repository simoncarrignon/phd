Quorum sensing cells (social)
Autocrine cells (cell communication)
Secret and send circuit : a similar circuit
Synthetic approach from bottom up

Gènes mirror gzography in europe
November et al 2008, nature
Cultural shift and genetic shift
Otzy the iceman geneome far away from the rest of central Europe.
Corsega.

Gunther gatherer more close. To northern Europe
Mesolitique from south
Cultural context

Neolithic farmer share with sardenya

Hunter gather Paleolithic north Europe.
(2014)

Omrak et al 20016 current biology
The new aera.

2/HG history Paleolithic upper Paleolithic more close to Neanderthal but just one individual.

Sunghir!
Close to kostenki. But not ancestor of HG. Mesure of the the ancestor using drift unit.
There where early European, but not the direct ancestor of European.
There happen admixture with Neanderthal.

3/ the genetic origin of European.
Genetic patern and language. Late creation

Gene->cell->circuit->system->behavior

Schizophrenia exemple.22q11 microdeletion.
Genetic prob associated with different phenotypes desease

Mouse model with artificial micro deletion. Tested with T-maze, (delayed non match to sample test. Spatial task to test working memory

Muted mouse doesn't succed in the task.

So the two extreme of the scale. The gene (microdeletion) to behav (t.maze task).

Hypocampus with prefrontal cortex. Both are altered , interaction between both are altered.
Syncor or asyncro local field potential (LFP) as EEG but deep in brain. In the hypocampus. Single spike in the prefrontal.
Statistically phase between prefrontal spikes and hippocampus phase.

In muted mice?:
Phase locking.? Computer move.. I don't get it.b
Hipocmpus send info to PFC.

The dedixite in synchronization can predict the time of learning in muted mice.

How arise the synchronization and why desynchronization appears?

No projection between dorsal hypocampus and PFC so need pass through the ventral. Truc pompe qui inhibite avec des fibre optique.
Allow to remove the direct connexion between ventral hippo to PFC. (Spellman et. Al nature 2015)
But pb with the setup.
So more complex task
Record of neurones to see if PFC encode the goal
Using max margin linear classifier. To try to see if the firing rate record can help to classifier where is the mice.

The link between pfx and hippocampus is used only to record the goal. So partial explanation at the circuit level.

Gene palmitoylation (Mukai et. Al, Neuron 2015)

Problem of axon development and growing. Branching pattern AR less complex in muted animal. They link the mutation to protein to phenotypes.
Inject Gsk3beta antagonist to recreate the good axone. Tamura et al neurone 2016.
Reuse of the classifier.
