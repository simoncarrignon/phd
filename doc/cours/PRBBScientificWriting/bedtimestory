Once upon a time there was an emperor governing a huge and prosperous empire during hundreds of year: the Roman Empire. I was a curious scientist and wanted to know how a single person can maintain and develop such a big and complex sytem during so long time. 
And this is what i did to find out: I reproduced a similar empire inside a computer and looked if this simulatd empire was able to be has huge, as prosperous and during as log as the Roman Empire. And it was not. So I tried millions of different simulated empire. And I looked at all the one that were able to maintain themselves during thousands and thousands of years. And I discovered that most of the time, the emperor doesn't need to work so much if people within the empire can exchange economic and socio-cultral informations often enough. 
And then I told people about my discoveries, and from then on, people everywhere knew that complex socio-economics change could easily apppear under a wide range of circumstances in human societies. And people were able to use my model to find what were those ranges for different human societies throughout human History, and even  predict the future ouf our own society. And that's the end of the story.
